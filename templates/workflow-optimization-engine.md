# Workflow Optimization Engine

## Overview
Intelligent workflow optimization system that analyzes execution patterns, identifies bottlenecks, and automatically improves task flows within Claude Code's capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. Execution Pattern Analysis
```yaml
pattern-analysis:
  data-collection:
    - execution-traces: "Complete task execution paths"
    - timing-metrics: "Stage and step durations"
    - resource-usage: "Token consumption patterns"
    - error-locations: "Failure points and recovery"
  
  pattern-recognition:
    - common-sequences: "Frequently repeated task flows"
    - bottleneck-detection: "Slow or failing stages"
    - redundancy-identification: "Duplicate operations"
    - optimization-opportunities: "Parallelization potential"
```

### 2. Performance Profiling
```yaml
performance-profiling:
  stage-metrics:
    reasoning-stage:
      average-duration: "2-5 minutes"
      token-usage: "1000-3000"
      success-rate: 0.95
      bottlenecks: ["complex requirement parsing"]
    
    planning-stage:
      average-duration: "3-7 minutes"
      token-usage: "2000-5000"
      success-rate: 0.90
      bottlenecks: ["dependency resolution"]
    
    implementation-stage:
      average-duration: "5-15 minutes"
      token-usage: "5000-15000"
      success-rate: 0.85
      bottlenecks: ["large file modifications"]
  
  optimization-targets:
    - reduce-redundant-file-reads: "Cache frequently accessed files"
    - parallelize-independent-tasks: "Identify parallelizable work"
    - optimize-context-passing: "Minimize context transfer size"
```

### 3. Dynamic Workflow Adjustment
```yaml
workflow-adjustments:
  runtime-optimization:
    - skip-unnecessary-stages: "Detect when stages can be bypassed"
    - merge-similar-operations: "Combine related tasks"
    - reorder-for-efficiency: "Optimize execution sequence"
    - parallelize-when-possible: "Split independent tasks"
  
  adaptive-strategies:
    simple-tasks:
      stages: ["planning", "implementation"]
      skip: ["reasoning", "verification"]
      
    complex-tasks:
      stages: ["reasoning", "research", "planning", "implementation", "verification"]
      parallel: ["multiple research agents", "independent implementations"]
    
    debugging-tasks:
      stages: ["analysis", "hypothesis", "testing", "fix", "verification"]
      iterate: true
```

### 4. Bottleneck Resolution
```yaml
bottleneck-solutions:
  common-bottlenecks:
    large-file-processing:
      problem: "Reading entire large files unnecessarily"
      solution: "Use targeted line ranges and search patterns"
      implementation: |
        Instead of: Read entire file
        Use: Grep for specific patterns first
        Then: Read only relevant sections
    
    redundant-research:
      problem: "Multiple agents researching same information"
      solution: "Shared research cache"
      implementation: |
        Create: .guild/memory/research-cache/
        Store: Research results with timestamps
        Reuse: Within time window (15 minutes)
    
    sequential-blocking:
      problem: "Tasks waiting unnecessarily"
      solution: "Identify parallel opportunities"
      implementation: |
        Analyze: Task dependencies
        Split: Independent subtasks
        Execute: Parallel agent instances
```

### 5. Intelligent Caching System
```yaml
caching-strategy:
  cache-types:
    file-content-cache:
      storage: ".guild/memory/cache/files/"
      ttl: "15 minutes"
      invalidation: "On file modification"
      
    research-result-cache:
      storage: ".guild/memory/cache/research/"
      ttl: "30 minutes"
      invalidation: "Manual or time-based"
    
    execution-plan-cache:
      storage: ".guild/memory/cache/plans/"
      ttl: "Session duration"
      invalidation: "On requirement change"
  
  cache-usage:
    before-file-read: "Check cache first"
    after-research: "Store results"
    plan-reuse: "Similar tasks use cached plans"
```

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Parallel Execution Optimization
```yaml
parallel-optimization:
  identification:
    - analyze-task-dependencies: "Build dependency graph"
    - find-independent-paths: "Identify parallel opportunities"
    - estimate-parallel-benefit: "Calculate time savings"
  
  execution-patterns:
    independent-files:
      pattern: "Multiple file modifications with no dependencies"
      optimization: "Parallel file processing agents"
      
    multi-technology:
      pattern: "Frontend and backend changes"
      optimization: "Specialized agents in parallel"
    
    test-and-implement:
      pattern: "Test creation alongside implementation"
      optimization: "Parallel test and code agents"
  
  coordination:
    - synchronization-points: "Define merge points"
    - context-merging: "Combine parallel results"
    - conflict-resolution: "Handle parallel conflicts"
```

### 2. Context Optimization
```yaml
context-optimization:
  reduction-strategies:
    selective-context:
      description: "Pass only relevant context"
      implementation: |
        Analyze: What each agent needs
        Filter: Remove irrelevant information
        Compress: Summarize when possible
    
    incremental-context:
      description: "Build context progressively"
      implementation: |
        Start: Minimal context
        Add: As needed during execution
        Prune: Remove used context
    
    shared-context-pool:
      description: "Central context repository"
      implementation: |
        Store: Common context centrally
        Reference: Instead of copying
        Update: Maintain single source of truth
```

### 3. Workflow Pruning
```yaml
workflow-pruning:
  unnecessary-stage-detection:
    - trivial-tasks: "Skip reasoning for simple operations"
    - known-patterns: "Skip planning for recognized patterns"
    - trusted-operations: "Skip verification for safe changes"
  
  conditional-stages:
    research-stage:
      condition: "Unknown technology OR complex integration"
      skip-when: "Simple changes in known codebase"
    
    verification-stage:
      condition: "Critical changes OR user request"
      skip-when: "Cosmetic changes OR documentation"
    
    refactoring-stage:
      condition: "Code quality issues detected"
      skip-when: "Clean implementation OR time constraints"
```

    - high-token-usage: "Approaching token limits"
    - repeated-errors: "Same error > 3 times"
    - stuck-workflow: "No progress > 5 minutes"
```
