# Guild System Overview

**Guild**: Command-specific workflow integration for Claude Code via external command system

## What is Guild?

Guild is an **optional, isolated workflow system** that transforms Claude Code tasks into command-specific workflow processes with specialized agent coordination. Guild operates completely externally to Claude Code and only activates when explicitly requested.

## Core Principles

### Complete Claude Code Separation
- **External Integration**: Guild works WITH Claude Code, never embedded IN Claude Code
- **Zero Code Modifications**: All Guild functionality remains external to Claude Code core
- **Command-Based Activation**: Guild ONLY activates when using `/guild:` prefixed commands
- **Normal Usage Unchanged**: Claude Code operates normally without Guild interference

### Command-Specific Workflow System
- **Command-Optimized Process**: Each command defines its optimal workflow sequence
- **Mandatory Start Sequence**: All workflows begin with reasoning ‚Üí research ‚Üí planning
- **Thin Agent Architecture**: Agents reference overview processes rather than containing logic
- **Template-Driven Implementation**: All workflow logic embedded in commands and templates

## Available Commands

Guild provides specialized commands with optimized workflows:

### Core Commands
- **`/guild:setup [guidance]`** - Analyze project and create specialized agents including mandatory guild-reasoning-agent
- **`/guild "task"`** - Execute any task with guild-reasoning-agent ‚Üí research ‚Üí planning ‚Üí implementation
- **`/guild:refactor "description"`** - Execute refactoring with guild-reasoning-agent ‚Üí research ‚Üí planning ‚Üí refactoring
- **`/guild:fix "bug"`** - Execute bug fixing with guild-reasoning-agent ‚Üí research ‚Üí planning ‚Üí diagnosis ‚Üí implementation
- **`/guild:plan "task"`** - Execute planning with guild-reasoning-agent ‚Üí research ‚Üí planning ‚Üí documentation
- **`/guild:spec [level] "spec"`** - Execute specification with guild-reasoning-agent ‚Üí research ‚Üí planning ‚Üí specification

### Management Commands  
- **`/guild:instructions`** - Manage project instructions and configuration options
- **`/guild:research`** - Context research engine with configurable MCP integration

**Important**: Guild commands are ONLY active when explicitly invoked with `/guild:` prefix. The workflow is completely isolated and does NOT automatically apply to all tasks.

## Guild System Architecture & Agent Compliance

**CRITICAL - MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS**: Every Guild agent MUST be aware of and reference this overview file (`.guild/overview.md`) as the central authority for Guild system operation. This overview serves as the primary endpoint for all Guild system rules, components, and compliance requirements.

### Guild System Core Functionality

**CRITICAL - MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS**: All Guild agents MUST follow these core system requirements and be aware of the complete Guild system architecture.

#### Mandatory Agent Compliance
- **Instructions Following**: Every agent MUST strictly adhere to workflow specifications in `.guild/instructions.md`
- **Ignore Pattern Respect**: ALL agents MUST respect patterns defined in `.guild/ignore.md` unless explicitly requested by user
- **Configuration Validation**: Agents must check for Guild configuration files and handle missing files gracefully
- **Workflow Integration**: All agents must integrate seamlessly with Guild's multi-stage workflow system
- **Quality Gates**: All agents must apply quality validation throughout their execution

## Standard Execution Framework

**CRITICAL**: All Guild commands follow standardized execution patterns defined below. Commands reference these standard frameworks instead of redefining them, ensuring consistency and maintainability across the entire Guild system.

### Standard Command Processing Framework

All Guild commands follow this three-phase processing structure:

#### Phase 1: Task Analysis
**Purpose**: Parse and validate command-specific requirements
**Pattern**: `**Parse [task-type]** for [specific requirements] and [context-specific details]`
**Variations**:
- **General Tasks**: Parse user prompt for task complexity and requirements
- **Bug Fixing**: Parse bug description for symptoms, reproduction steps, and technical context
- **Planning Tasks**: Parse task description for planning requirements and scope
- **Specifications**: Parse specification description for clarity, scope, and level requirements
- **Refactoring**: Parse refactoring prompt for improvement objectives and scope

#### Phase 2: Agent Selection
**Purpose**: Determine optimal agents based on task characteristics
**Pattern**: `**Determine [selection-criteria]** based on [task-type] and [project-context]`
**Standard Logic**: Analyze task requirements to select appropriate specialized agents from project's agent ecosystem

#### Phase 3: Workflow Activation
**Purpose**: Activate appropriate workflow composition for task type
**Pattern**: `**Activate [workflow-type]** [with task-specific considerations]`
**Reference**: Commands specify their workflow composition using stage definitions from "Workflow Step Definitions" section

### Standard Workflow Execution Protocol

**MANDATORY EXECUTION STEPS**: All Guild commands MUST follow this standardized 7-step execution protocol:

1. **Workflow Stage Compliance**: Follow workflow stages defined in `.guild/overview.md` [with command-specific completeness requirements]
2. **Ignore Pattern Respect**: Respect `.guild/ignore.md` patterns unless explicitly requested by user
3. **Agent Engagement**: Engage specialized agents from `.claude/agents/` directory based on [task-specific scope]
4. **Systematic Approach**: Maintain [command-specific approach] with validation at each step
5. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Apply comprehensive analysis to ALL agents throughout [task-type] process
6. **Stage Completion**: Complete all [command-specific number] stages before considering [task-type] complete
7. **Guild Compliance Validation**: Ensure all agents strictly follow Guild configuration files and reference `.guild/overview.md` as master authority

**EXECUTION VARIATIONS BY COMMAND TYPE**:
- **Simplified Workflows** (guild): Focus on essential stages with streamlined execution
- **Comprehensive Workflows** (guild:full): Complete all 8 stages with full validation
- **Specialized Workflows** (fix/refactor/plan/spec): Optimized stage sequences for specific task types

### Standard Agent Coordination Patterns

**UNIVERSAL AGENT COORDINATION**: All Guild commands follow standardized agent coordination patterns:

#### Core System Agents (Always Present)
- **guild-planning-agent**: Mandatory unified task analysis, planning, and routing coordination
- **guild-research-agent**: Context research specialist with configurable MCP integration and comprehensive background analysis

#### Specialized Agent Patterns (Command-Specific)
- **Planning Focus Commands**: Engage specialized planning agents for architectural design and strategic planning
- **Implementation Focus Commands**: Engage specialized implementation agents for code execution and development
- **Quality Focus Commands**: Prioritize specialized agents for system stability, validation, and quality assurance

#### Context Handoff Protocol
- **Clean Context Flow**: Single planning agent provides detailed specifications for unified engineers with well-defined interfaces
- **Parallel Execution**: Agents coordinate for simultaneous work where appropriate and beneficial
- **Quality Integration**: All agents maintain focus on [command-specific quality priorities]

### Standard Compliance Requirements

**CRITICAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS**: All Guild commands MUST adhere to these universal requirements:

#### Mandatory Execution Standards
- ‚úÖ **Stage 1 MANDATORY**: Every task MUST begin with prompt analysis and reasoning - NO EXCEPTIONS
- ‚úÖ **Sequential Execution**: Stages MUST be executed in order with proper context flow - NO STAGE SKIPPING
- ‚úÖ **Research Before Implementation**: Context research MUST be completed before implementation agent activation - NO DIRECT IMPLEMENTATION
- ‚úÖ **Clean Context Handoffs**: Single planning agent MUST provide detailed specifications for unified engineers with well-defined interfaces
- ‚úÖ **Analysis Mode**: ALL agents use deep analysis and multiple approaches throughout execution
- ‚úÖ **Implementation Verification**: Implementation agents must verify work against specifications and validate execution quality

#### Workflow Violation Prevention
- ‚ùå **No Direct Implementation**: NEVER proceed directly to implementation without completing required preceding stages
- ‚ùå **No Stage Skipping**: NEVER bypass any of the command-defined mandatory stages
- ‚ùå **No Context Breaking**: NEVER break clean context handoffs between planning and implementation agent transitions

#### System Integration Compliance
- **Master Reference Authority**: All execution must align with Guild system requirements defined in `.guild/overview.md`
- **Configuration Adherence**: All agents must follow requirements specified in `.guild/instructions.md`
- **Ignore Pattern Respect**: All operations must respect exclusion patterns in `.guild/ignore.md`
- **Quality Gate Integration**: Comprehensive validation at every workflow stage with systematic quality assurance

**FRAMEWORK REFERENCE**: Commands reference these standard execution frameworks using: "See `.guild/overview.md` 'Standard Execution Framework' for complete execution protocols and compliance requirements."
