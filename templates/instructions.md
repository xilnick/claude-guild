# Guild Project Intelligence Configuration

User prompts always override these instructions. These instructions override system defaults.

## Intelligence-Driven Configuration

This configuration is generated based on project pattern analysis and complexity profiling.

### Agent Configuration

```yaml
# Core agents with pattern-optimized thinking modes
guild-planning-agent:
  thinking_mode: ultrathink  # Strategic planning requires comprehensive analysis
  model: opus               # Enhanced model for complex planning

# Pattern-specialized agents (generated based on project analysis)
# These will be populated by /guild:setup based on your project's unique patterns
```

### Pattern-Based Requirements

**Generated Requirements**: The following requirements are derived from project pattern analysis:

*This section will be populated during /guild:setup based on:*
- **Architectural Pattern Analysis**: Requirements specific to your project's architectural style
- **Domain Pattern Requirements**: Constraints and conventions from your domain
- **Integration Pattern Standards**: Requirements for external system interactions  
- **Quality Pattern Enforcement**: Standards derived from your project's quality patterns

**Custom Requirements**: Add any additional project-specific requirements below:

### Intelligence Configuration Notes

- **Agent Thinking Modes**: Allocated based on complexity analysis
- **Context Management**: Optimized for your project's pattern complexity
- **Workflow Adaptation**: Configured for your project's development patterns
- **Quality Standards**: Aligned with your project's validation patterns
