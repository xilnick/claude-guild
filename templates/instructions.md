# Guild Project Instructions

User prompts always override these instructions. These instructions override system defaults.

## Agent Configuration

```yaml
guild-planning-agent:
  thinking_mode: ultrathink
  model: opus
```

Planning uses enhanced thinking for strategic quality. All other agents use standard thinking for efficiency.

## Project Requirements

Add any project-specific requirements that differ from standard Guild behavior. Leave empty if defaults work fine.
