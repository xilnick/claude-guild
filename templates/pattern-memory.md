## Learning Mechanisms

### Success Pattern Learning

```yaml
success_learning:
  trigger: Successful task completion
  
  process:
    1. capture_execution:
       - Record all workflow decisions
       - Track timing and performance
       - Note agent interactions
       
    2. analyze_success:
       - Identify key success factors
       - Compare with similar tasks
       - Calculate improvement metrics
       
    3. extract_pattern:
       - Generalize successful approach
       - Remove task-specific details
       - Create reusable template
       
    4. store_pattern:
       - Save to pattern database
       - Update pattern index
       - Link to source execution
       
    5. update_weights:
       - Increase confidence in approach
       - Adjust routing preferences
       - Update agent capabilities
       
  example:
    task: "Fix authentication bug"
    pattern_learned:
      - Always check middleware first
      - Test with multiple user roles
      - Verify token expiration
    future_application: Similar auth bugs route to same pattern
```

### Failure Pattern Learning

```yaml
failure_learning:
  trigger: Task failure or suboptimal result
  
  process:
    1. analyze_failure:
       - Identify failure point
       - Determine root cause
       - Check for patterns
       
    2. create_anti_pattern:
       - Document what not to do
       - Note warning signs
       - Define prevention strategies
       
    3. develop_recovery:
       - Create recovery workflow
       - Test alternative approaches
       - Validate solutions
       
    4. update_routing:
       - Adjust routing rules
       - Add validation checks
       - Implement safeguards
       
  example:
    failure: "Database migration failed"
    lessons_learned:
      - Always backup before migration
      - Check foreign key constraints
      - Test on staging first
    prevention: Add pre-migration validation step
```

        - Use cached results
      high_error_rate:
        - Add validation stages
        - Increase research depth
        - Use senior agents
        
  pattern_based:
    trigger: Pattern recognition
    actions:
      known_pattern:
        - Apply successful workflow
        - Skip unnecessary research
        - Direct routing
      unknown_pattern:
        - Increase research
        - Use conservative approach
        - Add verification steps
        
  feedback_based:
    trigger: User feedback
    actions:
      positive:
        - Reinforce decisions
        - Save as success pattern
        - Increase confidence
      negative:
        - Mark as anti-pattern
        - Develop alternatives
        - Decrease confidence
