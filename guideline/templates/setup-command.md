description: "Analyze [project-type] and create specialized agents based on discovered needs"
---

## Purpose
Initialize Guild system by analyzing project structure and creating specialized agents based on discovered project needs through systematic discovery and intelligent agent generation.

## User Request Processing

When $ARGUMENTS is provided, treat it as the user's specific request that guides this setup:
- Process $ARGUMENTS as primary task instructions that modify setup approach
- Adapt setup workflow based on user intent and requirements  
- Apply intelligent reasoning to determine optimal specialist needs for the request
- Allow $ARGUMENTS to override default behaviors when user intent is clear

## Mandatory Intelligence Compliance

**TEMPLATE REQUIREMENT**: This template enforces mandatory intelligence standards:

- **Zero Code Samples**: Template must never generate or include any code implementations, syntax examples, or executable snippets
- **Complete Technology Abstraction**: Template uses only abstract `[technology-stack]`, `[framework]`, `[language]` placeholder patterns
- **Template-First Patterns**: All guidance uses abstract `[placeholder]` patterns exclusively without specific implementations  
- **Agent Anti-Recursion**: Template ensures agents never create or invoke additional agents - flat hierarchy enforced
- **Native Intelligence Reliance**: Template trusts autonomous intelligence to determine optimal project-specific implementations
- **Creative Solution Preservation**: Template structure enables intelligent adaptation without constraining implementation choices

## Systematic Analysis & Preparation Process

**Project Analysis for Agent Preparation:**

3. **Boundaries**: Important limitations, recovery patterns, error handling, and anti-recursion constraints
4. **Outcomes**: Expected results, integration patterns, excellence targets, and [dimensional-compliance]

## Organization Structure

**Categorized Agent Organization:**
Agents are automatically organized into specialized directories under `.claude/agents/guild/`:

```
[project-path]/.claude/agents/guild/
├── [domain-1]/         # [Domain description and responsibilities]
│   └── [specialist].md
├── [domain-2]/         # [Domain description and responsibilities]
│   └── [specialist].md
├── [domain-3]/         # [Domain description and responsibilities]
│   └── [specialist].md
└── [domain-n]/         # [Domain description and responsibilities]
    └── [specialist].md
```

**Categories determined by:**
- [Project-technologies] and [architecture] discovered
- Natural [domain-boundaries] identified in analysis
- [Workflow-patterns] and complexity areas
- [Framework] sub-agent best practices
- Standardized organization for consistent specialist management

## Specialist Template

### Step 1: Domain-Based Agent Creation

**Use Claude's Write Tool for Agent Creation:**
After discovering [project-domains], create specialist agents using Write tool:

```
FOR EACH discovered [domain-area] in [project-analysis]:
  1. DETERMINE [specialist-name] based on [domain-expertise-needed]
  2. CREATE [domain-directory] if not exists: `.claude/agents/guild/[domain]/`
  3. USE Write tool to CREATE [agent-file]: `.claude/agents/guild/[domain]/[specialist-name].md`
  4. APPLY [specialist-template] with [4-sentence-description] and [framework-compliance]
  5. EMBED [anti-recursion-constraints] and [flat-hierarchy-enforcement] 
  6. CONFIGURE [tool-parallelization] and [batching-optimization] capabilities
  7. SET [coordination-patterns] and [integration-interfaces]
```

**Agent Creation Protocol:**
- **Analysis First**: Thoroughly analyze project to identify [natural-domains] and [specialist-needs]
- **Template Application**: Use Write tool with complete agent template for each specialist
- **Directory Organization**: Create agents in logical [category-directories] based on discovered [domain-boundaries]
- **Compliance Verification**: Ensure each created agent includes [anti-recursion-constraints] and [4-sentence-description]
- **Integration Setup**: Configure [coordination-patterns] between related specialists for optimal collaboration

### Step 2: Agent Template Application
For each created agent, apply this template structure:
```markdown

[Anti-recursion enforcement and flat hierarchy maintenance]

## Success Criteria
[Expected outcomes and performance metrics for this domain]
```

### Step 3: Directory Organization
Automatically organize agents into discovered categories:
```
.claude/agents/guild/
├── [discovered-domain-1]/     # Based on project analysis
│   └── [specialist-name].md
├── [discovered-domain-2]/     # Natural project boundaries
│   └── [specialist-name].md  
└── [discovered-domain-n]/     # Tool-optimized categories
    └── [specialist-name].md
```
