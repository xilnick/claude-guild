## Purpose

Let Claude Code intelligently analyze your project and create exactly the research agents and persistent specialists needed. No predetermined categories, no hardcoded structures - pure adaptive intelligence that discovers optimal agent architecture through deep project research.

## 🔬 **PURE INTELLIGENCE-DRIVEN RESEARCH & AGENT CREATION**

### **Adaptive Research Intelligence**
**Claude Code intelligently determines what research is needed and creates appropriate research agents:**

```
🧠 "Analyzing project to determine optimal research approach..." 
🔍 "Creating research agents based on project characteristics discovered..."
🤖 "Research agents investigating project-specific patterns and requirements..."
📊 "Synthesizing research findings to design optimal persistent agent architecture..."
✅ "Creating persistent agents perfectly matched to discovered project needs..."
```

**No predetermined phases, categories, or agent types - Claude Code determines everything based on intelligent project analysis.**

### **Research-First Approach**
