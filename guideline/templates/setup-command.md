## Command Purpose
Create persistent, project-specialized agents through deep analysis and intelligent discovery.

## 🔬 **SETUP-SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE**

### **Phase 1: Project Intelligence Gathering**

🔍 **Project Discovery** (2-3 min):
- Scan configuration files for technology stack
- Detect architectural patterns and paradigms
- Identify data flows and integration points
- Map quality standards and conventions

📊 **Complexity Assessment**:
- Analyze business logic concentration
- Identify core domain entities
- Map critical user workflows
- Assess system boundaries

### **Phase 2: Agent Creation Strategy**

🎯 **Boundary Detection**:
- Natural component boundaries
- Technology layer separation
- Integration point mapping
- Conflict-free work areas

🤖 **Agent Generation**:
```yaml
Agent Creation Pattern:
  For Each Domain:
    1. Analyze problem space
    2. Generate specialization
    3. Embed project context
    4. Define boundaries
    5. Establish protocols
```

### **Phase 3: Persistent Agent Output**

📁 **Generated Structure**:
```

└── learning-framework.md    # Continuous improvement
```

### **Setup Success Criteria**
✅ All technologies covered by specialists  
✅ Clear non-overlapping boundaries  
✅ Project patterns embedded  
✅ Coordination protocols defined  
✅ Verification integrated  
✅ Learning framework initialized
