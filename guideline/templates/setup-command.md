description: "Analyze [project-type] and create specialized agents based on discovered needs"
---

## Purpose
Initialize Guild system by analyzing project structure and creating specialized agents based on discovered project needs through systematic discovery and intelligent agent generation.

## User Request Processing

When $ARGUMENTS is provided, treat it as ADDITIONAL specialist requests to supplement standard discovery:
- ALWAYS perform comprehensive project discovery and create domain specialists
- Process $ARGUMENTS as supplementary specialist requests to create IN ADDITION to discovered specialists
- Apply intelligent reasoning to integrate user-requested specialists with discovered domain specialists
- NEVER allow $ARGUMENTS to replace or skip the baseline discovery and agent generation process

## Deep Project Discovery Intelligence

**Philosophy**: Comprehensively understand the ENTIRE system - architecture, dependencies, patterns, and context - to create agents with complete domain knowledge.

EXECUTE discovery through [multi-layer-parallel-analysis] using Task tool with mandatory [parallel-tool-execution] and systematic dimensional integration (Reference: @config:TB001, @config:AM001, @config:PE001, @config:RP001, @config:AR001, @config:OB001).

**ARCHITECTURAL BOUNDARY**: Creates agents with embedded parallel capabilities, NEVER executes them. Setup = Agent Factory.
