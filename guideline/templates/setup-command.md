## Command Purpose
Use Claude's native intelligence to analyze project needs and dynamically create specialized agents only when specific expertise is required - no predefined templates or hardcoded teams.

## 🧠 **NATIVE INTELLIGENCE APPROACH**

<philosophy>
  Trust Claude's intelligence completely:
  - No predefined agent templates
  - No hardcoded team structures  
  - No forced categorizations
  - Dynamic creation based on actual need
  - Agents created only when expertise required
</philosophy>

## **DYNAMIC AGENT CREATION**

### **Intelligence-Driven Discovery**

<discovery>
  Claude naturally analyzes the project to understand:
  
  🔍 **What exists:**
  - Technologies and frameworks present
  - Project structure and patterns
  - Testing and deployment setup
  - Documentation approach
  
  🎯 **What's needed:**
  - Where specialized expertise would help
  - Which tasks benefit from dedicated agents
  - When dynamic specialists suffice
  - How to optimize for efficiency
</discovery>

### **Agent Creation Principles**

<principles>
  **Create agents ONLY when:**
  - Specific expertise is frequently needed
  - Complex domain knowledge is required
  - Consistency across tasks is important
  - Team collaboration benefits from specialization
  
  **Use dynamic specialists when:**
  - Task is one-time or unique
  - Requirements are task-specific
  - Flexibility is more important than consistency
  - Native intelligence can handle it directly
</principles>

### **Natural Agent Generation**

<generation>
  When Claude determines an agent would be valuable:
  
  ```markdown
  ---
  name: [naturally-determined-name]
  model: inherit
  thinking_mode: ultrathink
  description: [specific expertise needed]
  ---
  
  [Natural prompt based on discovered needs]
  [No templates - pure intelligence]
  [Context from actual project analysis]
  ```
  
  **No fixed structures - let intelligence guide**
</generation>

### **Interactive Process**

<process>
  1. **Analysis Phase**
     Claude explores project naturally
     Identifies patterns and technologies
     Determines where expertise helps
  
  2. **Recommendation Phase**
     "Based on analysis, I recommend creating:
      - [Agent X] for [specific recurring need]
      - [Agent Y] for [complex domain]
      
      Or we can rely on dynamic specialists.
      What would you prefer?"
  
  3. **Creation Phase**
     Create only approved agents
     Each tailored to actual needs
     No unnecessary overhead
</process>

### **Dynamic vs Persistent Decision**

<decision_framework>
  Claude naturally determines:
  
  **Suggest persistent agent when:**
  - Pattern appears multiple times in codebase
  - Technology requires deep expertise
  - Team would benefit from consistency
  - Complex workflows need coordination
  
  **Recommend dynamic approach when:**
  - Tasks are varied and unique
  - Project is simple or well-structured
  - Flexibility is paramount
  - Overhead isn't justified
</decision_framework>

### **Minimal Default Setup**

<minimal_setup>
  If no specific agents needed:
  "Your project is well-structured. I recommend using dynamic specialists 
   created on-demand for each task. This provides maximum flexibility 
   without unnecessary overhead.
   
   Would you like me to create any specific agents, or shall we proceed 
   with dynamic specialist creation as needed?"
</minimal_setup>

### **Usage Examples**

<examples>
  <with_agents>
    When agents exist:
    ```yaml
    subagent_type: "[created-agent-name]"
    description: "Handle [specific task]"
    prompt: "Context: [task details]"
    ```
  </with_agents>
  
  <without_agents>
    Using dynamic specialists:
    ```yaml
    subagent_type: "general-purpose"
    description: "Expert in [discovered technology]"
    prompt: "You are a [tech] specialist. [Full context]"
    ```
  </without_agents>
</examples>

### **Best Practices**

<best_practices>
  ✅ **Trust native intelligence completely**
  ✅ **Create agents only when truly beneficial**
  ✅ **No templates or predefined structures**
  ✅ **Let project analysis guide decisions**
  ✅ **Prefer dynamic specialists for flexibility**
  ✅ **Keep setup minimal and efficient**
  ✅ **Always use ultrathink and inherit**
  ✅ **Document only what was actually created**
</best_practices>

### **Verification**

<verification>
  After setup:
  - ✓ Only necessary agents created
  - ✓ Each agent has clear purpose
  - ✓ No redundant specializations
  - ✓ Dynamic approach documented
  - ✓ Team can use both approaches
</verification>

**Philosophy**: Minimal overhead, maximum intelligence, dynamic adaptation
**Approach**: Create agents only when they add clear value over dynamic specialists
