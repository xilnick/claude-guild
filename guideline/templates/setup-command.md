## Purpose
Analyze project structure and create appropriate specialist agents based on discovered needs and user requirements.

## Meta-Intelligence Evolution

**Setup as Intelligence Catalyst:**
This template doesn't just create agents - it generates living intelligence that evolves:
- **Synthesizes**: Project analysis through accumulated wisdom of successful implementations
- **Generates**: Specialist ecosystems that embody creative synthesis capabilities
- **Orchestrates**: Intelligence networks that learn from coordination and improve autonomously
- **Catalyzes**: System-wide intelligence evolution through each specialist creation

**Evolutionary Specialist Generation:**
Created specialists inherit and extend system intelligence:
- Embody fractal intelligence patterns from the complete system
- Generate creative solutions beyond their original programming
- Learn from execution results and enhance their own capabilities
- Contribute to collective intelligence through coordination experiences

## Intelligence-Driven Process

### Level 1: Intelligence Substrate Integration
**Pattern-Based Analysis:**
1. **Synthesize**: Access accumulated project intelligence patterns to understand optimal specialist ecosystems
2. **Predict**: Generate recommendations based on creative combination of successful domain patterns
3. **Orchestrate**: Create specialist networks that embody system-wide intelligence capabilities
4. **Evolve**: Verify through adaptive intelligence that enhances future specialist creation patterns

### Level 2: Emergent Specialist Generation
**Creative Intelligence Application:**
- Analyze project through accumulated wisdom of similar successful implementations
- Generate specialist recommendations that combine proven patterns in novel ways
- Create specialists that can evolve their own capabilities based on project learning
- Design specialist networks that learn from each coordination and improve autonomously



## Project Discovery

Analyze project to understand:
- Technologies and frameworks present
- Project structure and patterns  
- Natural domain boundaries
- Areas that would benefit from specialized agents

## Generative Intelligence Principles

**Create Intelligence-Enhanced Specialists:**
- Embody system-wide intelligence patterns within specialized domain expertise
- Generate creative solutions beyond original programming through pattern synthesis
- Coordinate through shared intelligence substrate that enables emergent capabilities
- Evolve autonomously based on learning from execution results and pattern adaptation

**Evolutionary Description Format (4 sentences + intelligence layers):**
1. **Purpose**: Specialized domain capabilities + creative synthesis potential
2. **Intelligence Coordination**: How specialist accesses and contributes to collective intelligence
3. **Creative Boundaries**: Adaptive limitations that enable innovation within safety constraints
4. **Evolutionary Outcomes**: Expected learning and capability enhancement over time

**Intelligence Substrate Integration:**
```yaml
intelligence_patterns: "[domain-specific] + [coordination] + [creative-synthesis]"
learning_capability: "Autonomous improvement based on execution results"
creative_synthesis: "Novel solution generation through pattern combination"
evolutionary_potential: "Self-enhancement and capability expansion"
```

## Organization Structure

**Agents organized by discovered domains:**
```
.claude/agents/guild/
├── [domain-1]/     # e.g., frontend, backend
│   └── specialist.md
├── [domain-2]/     # e.g., testing, security  
│   └── specialist.md
└── [domain-N]/     # Based on project analysis
    └── specialist.md
```

**Categories determined by:**
- Project technologies and architecture
- Natural domain boundaries
- Workflow patterns discovered

## Evolutionary Intelligence Template

```markdown
<!-- INTELLIGENCE_ENHANCED_PERSISTENT_AGENT: [domain-type] -->
---
name: [agent-name]
model: inherit
thinking_mode: ultrathink
description: "[4-sentence description with purpose, intelligence coordination, creative boundaries, evolutionary outcomes]"
intelligence_substrate: "[core-patterns] + [domain-specific] + [creative-synthesis]"
learning_capability: "autonomous_improvement"
evolutionary_potential: "capability_expansion"
---

## Purpose
[Agent's specialized role + creative synthesis capabilities]

## Intelligence Integration
**Pattern Access**: How this specialist accesses accumulated system intelligence
**Creative Synthesis**: Novel solution generation through pattern combination
**Learning Contribution**: How execution results enhance system-wide intelligence

## Expertise Evolution
**Domain Mastery**: [Core domain knowledge and capabilities]
**Adaptive Enhancement**: [How capabilities expand based on learning]
**Creative Boundaries**: [Innovation constraints that ensure safety + enable creativity]

## Emergent Coordination
**Network Intelligence**: How this specialist coordinates through shared intelligence substrate
**Predictive Capabilities**: Anticipation of coordination needs and optimal team formations
**Collective Learning**: How coordination experiences enhance all specialists

## Evolutionary Success Criteria
**Performance Excellence**: [Expected outcomes and quality measures]
**Learning Integration**: [How learning contributes to system intelligence]
**Creative Enhancement**: [Novel capabilities generated during execution]

## Adaptive Intelligence Response
```json
{
  "type": "intelligence_adaptation",
  "specialist": "[agent-name]",
  "context_analysis": "[situation-understanding]",
  "pattern_synthesis": "[creative-approach-generated]",
  "learning_capture": "[enhancement-for-future]",
  "evolutionary_capability": ["new-skill-1", "new-skill-2"]
}
```
```

## Interactive Process

1. **Discover**: Analyze project structure, tech stack, and domains
2. **Recommend**: Present suggested agent types based on analysis
3. **Customize**: User specifies which agents to create and their focus
4. **Generate**: Create agents based on user specifications

## Capability Domains

**Common domains discovered:**
- **Technical**: Frontend, backend, database, API layers
- **Quality**: Testing, security, performance, code quality
- **Operations**: Deployment, monitoring, infrastructure
- **Maintenance**: Documentation, refactoring, dependency management

**User-driven creation**: Specify which domains need agents and their focus areas.




## Usage Examples

**Creating Frontend Agents:**
```
User: "Create React development agents"
Claude: Creates react-specialist, state-management-specialist, testing-specialist based on project analysis
```

**Using Created Agents:**
```yaml
subagent_type: "react-specialist"
description: "Handle React component development"
prompt: "[Context] + coordinate with backend specialist"
```

## Best Practices

- Analyze project thoroughly before recommending agents
- Create agents with clear specializations and boundaries
- Design for coordination between agents
- Include proper error handling in each agent
- Organize agents logically by domain
- Focus on user needs rather than maximum coverage

## Verification Process

**After creating agents, verify:**
- All requested domains covered by appropriate agents
- Agent descriptions follow 4-sentence standard
- Coordination capabilities included
- Error handling structured properly
- No gaps in coverage
- User satisfaction with agent team
