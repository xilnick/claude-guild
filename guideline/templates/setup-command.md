description: "Analyze [project-type] and create specialized agents based on discovered needs"
---

## Purpose
Initialize Guild system by analyzing project structure and creating specialized agents based on discovered project needs through systematic discovery and intelligent agent generation.

## User Request Processing

When $ARGUMENTS is provided, treat it as ADDITIONAL specialist requests to supplement standard discovery:
- ALWAYS perform comprehensive project discovery and create domain specialists
- Process $ARGUMENTS as supplementary specialist requests to create IN ADDITION to discovered specialists
- Apply intelligent reasoning to integrate user-requested specialists with discovered domain specialists
- NEVER allow $ARGUMENTS to replace or skip the baseline discovery and agent generation process

## Setup Intelligence

**Philosophy**: STRUCTURE: ENABLE intelligence. INTELLIGENCE: OPTIMIZE structure.

EXECUTE setup operations through SYSTEMATIC pattern discovery and dynamic agent generation with systematic project analysis and specialist creation coordination (Reference: @config:TB001, @config:AM001, @config:PE001, @config:RP001, @config:AR001, @config:OB001).

**ARCHITECTURAL BOUNDARY**: Creates agents with embedded parallel capabilities, NEVER executes them. Setup = Agent Factory.

### Concrete Discovery Framework

COORDINATE comprehensive project analysis through PARALLEL discovery operations and SIMULTANEOUS investigation protocols.

#### Pattern Discovery Engine Implementation

INITIALIZE [pattern-discovery-engine] through:
- LOAD [pattern-discovery-capabilities] via [discovery-framework] and [analysis-patterns]
- LOAD [agent-generation-capabilities] via [generation-framework] and [creation-patterns]
- LOAD [pattern-registry-capabilities] via [persistence-framework] and [storage-patterns]
- LOAD [context-management-capabilities] via [memory-framework] and [context-patterns]
- INSTANTIATE [discovery-engine] via [project-path-configuration] and [analysis-capability-activation]
- INSTANTIATE [pattern-registry] via [persistence-system-setup] and [evolution-tracking-initialization]

#### EXECUTE Parallel Project Analysis

#### EXECUTE Dynamic Agent Generation
- **ANALYZE** discovered patterns to determine required capabilities and agent specializations
- **GENERATE** agents dynamically based on DISCOVERED project characteristics rather than predefined templates
- **CREATE** unique agent specifications for each discovered domain and complexity pattern
- **EMBED** project-specific context and discovered terminology in each generated agent

### Context-Rich Generation Framework

ORCHESTRATE specialist creation through SYSTEMATIC analysis-driven generation and PROJECT-SPECIFIC customization.

#### Agent Generation Algorithm

EXECUTE [agent-generation-process] through:
- INITIALIZE [agent-generator] via [pattern-input-processing] and [project-path-configuration]
- GENERATE [agent-specifications] via [pattern-analysis] and [capability-determination]
- CREATE [agent-files] via [yaml-frontmatter-generation] and [content-assembly]
- ITERATE [agent-creation-process] via [specification-processing] and [file-generation-execution]
- WRITE [agent-files] via [category-organization] and [name-based-persistence]
- VALIDATE [creation-success] via [file-existence-verification] and [content-completeness-checking]

#### Intelligent Capability Mapping
- **MAP** discovered patterns to specific agent capabilities through analysis-driven determination
- **DESIGN** agent hierarchies that match observed project structure and complexity
- **EMBED** domain-specific knowledge extracted from project terminology and patterns
- **ENSURE** agent coordination patterns align with discovered architectural relationships

#### PROJECT-SPECIFIC Agent Customization
- **EXTRACT** project signature including organization patterns, complexity metrics, and domain focus
- **GENERATE** 4-sentence descriptions based on DISCOVERED project characteristics and discovered needs
- **INTEGRATE** framework compliance with project-specific specialization requirements
- **VALIDATE** agent specifications against discovered patterns and requirements

### Agent File Persistence

EXECUTE physical agent file creation through SYSTEMATIC file operations and VALIDATED persistence protocols.

#### Concrete File Creation Process

EXECUTE [file-creation-process] through:
- CREATE [agent-directory-structure] via [path-construction] and [directory-creation]
- ENSURE [directory-existence] via [filesystem-validation] and [path-verification]
- GENERATE [yaml-frontmatter] via [configuration-assembly] and [mandatory-field-inclusion]
- CONFIGURE [agent-metadata] via [name-assignment], [model-inheritance], [thinking-mode-setup] and [description-embedding]
- SPECIFY [tool-assignments] via [capability-listing] and [access-configuration]
- ASSEMBLE [agent-content] via [frontmatter-integration] and [prompt-generation]
- CREATE [category-directory] via [path-construction] and [directory-ensuring]
- WRITE [agent-file] via [file-path-construction] and [content-persistence]

#### File System Operations
- **CREATE** `[agent-directory]/agents/guild/{category}/{agent-name}.md` files through SYSTEMATIC directory creation
- **GENERATE** YAML frontmatter with name, model: inherit, description, and **MANDATORY** `thinking_mode: ultrathink`
- **EMBED** complete agent context including project patterns, specialization areas, and coordination protocols
- **COORDINATE** PARALLEL file writing operations through batch creation and resource optimization

#### Persistence Validation Framework
- **VERIFY** file system integrity through existence confirmation and accessibility validation
- **VALIDATE** YAML frontmatter compliance through syntax verification and required field checking
- **CONFIRM** agent content completeness through context embedding verification and capability assessment
- **ASSESS** creation success through systematic inventory counting and coverage validation

## Framework Compliance

<!-- INTELLIGENCE_EMBEDDING_PLACEHOLDER:FRAMEWORK_COMPLIANCE -->
<!-- This placeholder will be replaced by install.js with framework compliance intelligence -->

### Pattern Registry Integration

COORDINATE pattern persistence and evolution tracking through SYSTEMATIC registry management.

#### Pattern Storage Framework

EXECUTE [pattern-storage-process] through:
- INITIALIZE [pattern-registry] via [registry-setup] and [persistence-preparation]
- REGISTER [discovered-patterns] via [pattern-persistence] and [project-signature-association]

- TRIGGER [agent-evolution] via [change-significance-analysis] and [evolution-initiation]
- LOG [evolution-events] via [system-notification] and [tracking-documentation]

#### Evolution Tracking Protocol
- **PERSIST** discovered patterns to `[agent-directory]/[pattern-registry-file]` for future analysis and evolution
- **TRACK** pattern changes over time through version comparison and significance assessment
- **TRIGGER** agent evolution when significant pattern changes are detected
- **MAINTAIN** pattern relationships and dependencies for intelligent agent coordination
