  </phase_3_proactive_agent_creation>
  
  <phase_4_unified_agent_verification>
    **MANDATORY: Framework-Aligned Agent Team Verification**
    
    **UNIFIED SUCCESS METRICS HIERARCHY (FROM FRAMEWORK):**
    1. User satisfaction with agent team (ultimate authority)
    2. Technical verification of agent capabilities (functional requirements)

    2. **Integrated Agent Planning**: Coordinate agent additions/refinements across all findings
    3. **Parallel Agent Implementation**: Create/refine agents across multiple domains simultaneously
    4. **Cross-Domain Agent Re-verification**: Verify agent team completeness across all streams
    5. **User Satisfaction Confirmation**: Continue until explicit user approval of complete agent team
    
    **AGENT TEAM CONFLICT RESOLUTION:**
    - If agent capabilities complete but user unsatisfied → iterate agent team until user satisfied
    - If user satisfied but agent coverage incomplete → fill gaps while maintaining satisfaction
    - User satisfaction has final authority over agent team, but comprehensive coverage required

  ### **Proactive Project Decomposition Framework**
  
  **Phase 1: Parallel Opportunity Discovery**
  - **SYSTEMATICALLY ANALYZE** project structure for parallel agent deployment opportunities
  - **PROACTIVELY IDENTIFY** all capability domains that can support simultaneous agents
  - **AGGRESSIVELY MAP** technology boundaries enabling concurrent specialist work

  ### **Decomposition Decision Trees**
  
  **Agent Creation Decision Matrix:**
  ```
  FOR EACH DISCOVERED DOMAIN:
  ┗ Can this domain support multiple specialists? → YES: Recommend 3-7 agents
    ┗ Are there sub-specializations? → YES: Create specialist per sub-domain
      ┗ Can specialists work in parallel? → YES: Design for simultaneous operation
        ┗ What coordination is needed? → Define integration checkpoints
  ```
  
  **Parallel Opportunity Assessment:**
  ```
  FOR EACH PROJECT ASPECT:
  ┗ Is this independent from other aspects? → YES: Separate parallel agents
    ┗ Does this have multiple sub-components? → YES: Multiple specialists
      ┗ Can sub-components be developed simultaneously? → YES: Parallel agent team
        ┗ How do they integrate? → Design coordination protocols
  ```

### **Category-Based Organization**

<category_organization>
  **Directory Structure Based on Project Discovery:**
  
  Claude analyzes your project and creates logical categories:
  
  ```bash

### **Usage Examples**

<examples>
  <with_comprehensive_agent_teams>
    When comprehensive agent teams exist (RECOMMENDED):
    ```yaml
    # BATCH AGENT UTILIZATION - Use multiple agents simultaneously
    subagent_type: "[frontend-react-specialist]"
    description: "Handle React component development with backend coordination"
    prompt: "Context: [task details] + Coordinate with backend and testing agents at [sync points]"
    
    subagent_type: "[backend-api-specialist]" 
    description: "Handle API development with frontend coordination"
    prompt: "Context: [task details] + Provide data contracts to frontend agent + Sync at [integration checkpoints]"
    
    subagent_type: "[testing-integration-specialist]"
    description: "Handle testing across frontend and backend agent outputs"
    prompt: "Context: [task details] + Test integration between frontend and backend agents + Report coordination issues"
    ```
  </with_comprehensive_agent_teams>
  
  <with_dynamic_specialists_enhanced>
    Using enhanced dynamic specialists (when agents not yet created):
    ```yaml
    # PARALLEL DYNAMIC SPECIALISTS - Create multiple simultaneously
    subagent_type: "general-purpose"
    description: "[Technology] specialist with parallel coordination capabilities"
    prompt: "You are a [tech] specialist. [Full context] + Coordinate with [other specialist types] + Integration checkpoints: [specific points] + Report coordination needs for future agent creation"
    
    subagent_type: "general-purpose"
    description: "Coordination specialist managing parallel specialist integration"
    prompt: "You coordinate between [specialist types]. [Context] + Manage integration between specialists + Identify agent creation opportunities + Report on specialist team effectiveness"
    ```
