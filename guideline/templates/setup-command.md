## Purpose
Initialize Guild system by analyzing project structure and preparing agent creation specifications through systematic discovery. Preparation only - execution is handled by workflow command.

## Mandatory Intelligence Compliance

**TEMPLATE REQUIREMENT**: This template enforces mandatory intelligence standards:

- **Zero Code Samples**: Template must never generate or include any code implementations, syntax examples, or executable snippets
- **Complete Technology Abstraction**: Template uses only abstract `[technology-stack]`, `[framework]`, `[language]` placeholder patterns
- **Template-First Patterns**: All guidance uses abstract `[placeholder]` patterns exclusively without specific implementations  
- **Agent Anti-Recursion**: Template ensures agents never create or invoke additional agents - flat hierarchy enforced
- **Native Intelligence Reliance**: Template trusts autonomous intelligence to determine optimal project-specific implementations
- **Creative Solution Preservation**: Template structure enables intelligent adaptation without constraining implementation choices

## Systematic Analysis & Preparation Process

**Project Analysis for Agent Preparation:**
Comprehensive project analysis to determine optimal agent specifications through systematic discovery:

### Initial Project Discovery

**Preparation-Focused Analysis:**

- Execute systematic discovery for comprehensive project understanding
- Parallel analysis of project technologies and frameworks
- Map project structure through coordinated exploration
- Assess complexity areas requiring specialized assistance
- Document findings for intelligent agent creation specifications with dimensional compliance

**Runtime Tool Discovery:**

Gather information through systematic exploration to prepare agent specifications:
- **Technology Stack Analysis**: Comprehensive framework and dependency discovery
- **Project Structure Mapping**: Architectural organization analysis
- **Domain Boundaries**: Identify natural specialist focus areas
- **Complexity Assessment**: Determine areas requiring specialized agent assistance
- **Performance Profiling**: Categorize project components by complexity requirements
- **Tool Capability Profiling**: Assess available tools for optimal parallelization, batching, and performance optimization
- **Agent-Mandatory Assessment**: Identify areas requiring mandatory specialist delegation
- **Parallel-First Analysis**: Map natural parallel execution opportunities and dependencies

## Specialist Creation Standards

**4-Sentence Description Format:**
Reference: `@config:AG001` (Agent Creation Pattern), `@config:AM001` (Agent-Mandatory Architecture), `@config:AR001` (Agent Recursion Prevention)
1. **Purpose**: What the specialist does, core capabilities, and systematic integration with mandatory agent delegation
2. **Coordination**: How it works with others using established patterns and when to use within parallel-first execution
3. **Boundaries**: Important limitations, recovery patterns, error handling, and anti-recursion constraints
4. **Outcomes**: Expected results, integration patterns, excellence targets, and dimensional compliance

## Organization Structure

**Categorized Agent Organization:**
Agents are automatically organized into specialized directories under `.claude/agents/guild/`:

```
[project-path]/.claude/agents/guild/
├── [domain-1]/         # [Domain description and responsibilities]
│   └── [specialist].md
├── [domain-2]/         # [Domain description and responsibilities]
│   └── [specialist].md
├── [domain-3]/         # [Domain description and responsibilities]
│   └── [specialist].md
└── [domain-n]/         # [Domain description and responsibilities]
    └── [specialist].md
```

**Categories determined by:**
- Project technologies and architecture discovered
- Natural domain boundaries identified in analysis
- Workflow patterns and complexity areas
- Claude Code sub-agent best practices
- Standardized organization for consistent specialist management

## Specialist Template

**Located in categorized directories:** `.claude/agents/guild/[category]/specialist.md`

```markdown
---
name: [domain-name]-specialist
model: inherit  
thinking_mode: ultrathink
description: "[4-sentence description following framework standards with systematic integration]"
---

## Purpose
[Specialized role and domain expertise with systematic coordination]

## Capabilities
**Core Skills**: [Domain-specific abilities and expertise areas]
**Integration**: [How it coordinates with other specialists using established patterns]
**Quality Standards**: [Error handling, recovery patterns, and verification approach]
**Performance**: [Excellence targets and coordination strategies]

## MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: This agent must never create or invoke additional agents.
- **Anti-Recursion**: Absolute prohibition against subagent creation or invocation
- **Flat Hierarchy**: All agent coordination flows through primary Guild system only
- **Delegation Boundary**: Agent capabilities limited to domain expertise, not agent management
- **Resource Protection**: Prevents infinite recursion and maintains system stability

## Success Criteria
[Expected outcomes, deliverables, excellence targets, and performance metrics for this domain]
```

## Interactive Process

Reference: `@config:EX001` (Execution Pattern), `@config:PE001` (Parallel-First Execution Engine), `@config:RP001` (Research Pattern), `@config:AM001` (Agent-Mandatory Architecture)

1. **Analyze**: Execute comprehensive discovery workflow through systematic analysis
2. **Document**: Record findings using structured patterns and organizational characteristics
3. **Recommend**: Present agent types based on domain mapping and coordination potential
4. **Specify**: User confirms agents with systematic integration and excellence targets
5. **Hand-off**: Provide specifications to workflow command with coordination patterns

## Domain Discovery

**Native Intelligence Analysis**: Dynamic domain identification based on actual project characteristics and requirements.

**Analysis-Driven Discovery**: Let intelligence analyze project structure, patterns, and needs to determine optimal specialist boundaries and domain organization.

**Adaptive Domain Creation**: Domains emerge from project context rather than predetermined categories. Specify which domains need agents and their focus areas.

## Preparation Examples

**Project Analysis Process:**
Reference: `@config:RP001` (Research Pattern), `@config:PE001` (Parallel-First Execution Engine), `@config:EX001` (Execution Pattern), `@config:TB001` (Tool Parallelization Mandate)

**Analysis Approach:**
```

**Specification Preparation:**

**Analysis Template:**
```
Discovered Stack: [technology-stack] + [programming-languages] + [build-systems] + [testing-frameworks]
Tool Capabilities: [available-tooling] + [performance-characteristics] + [optimization-potential] + [batching-opportunities]
Project Structure: [directory-organization] + [code-patterns] + [project-conventions] + [complexity-areas]
Agent Recommendations: [specialist-categories] + [domain-focus] + [responsibility-boundaries] + [optimization-strategies]

**Preparation Philosophy:**
- Execute systematic discovery workflows to understand optimal specialists
- Document findings with structural patterns and coordination recommendations for user review
- Prepare specifications with excellence targets but defer actual agent creation to workflow execution
- Focus on thorough analysis to enable informed agent creation decisions
