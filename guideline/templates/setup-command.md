description: "Analyze [project-type] and create specialized agents based on discovered needs"
---

## Purpose
**Philosophy**: Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes structure.

Initialize Guild system by analyzing project structure and creating specialized agents based on discovered project needs through systematic discovery and intelligent agent generation with comprehensive dimensional integration (Reference: @config:TB001, @config:AM001, @config:PE001, @config:RP001, @config:AR001, @config:OB001).

## User Request Processing

When $ARGUMENTS is provided, treat it as the user's specific request that guides this setup:
- Process $ARGUMENTS as primary task instructions that modify setup approach
- Adapt setup workflow based on user intent and requirements  
- Apply intelligent reasoning to determine optimal specialist needs for the request
- Allow $ARGUMENTS to override default behaviors when user intent is clear

## Mandatory Intelligence Compliance

**TEMPLATE REQUIREMENT**: This template enforces mandatory intelligence standards with enhanced abstraction compliance:

- **Zero Code Samples**: Template must never generate or include any code implementations, syntax examples, or executable snippets through [abstraction-validation]
- **Complete Technology Abstraction**: Template uses only abstract `[technology-stack]`, `[framework]`, `[language]` placeholder patterns with [technology-independence-verification]
- **Template-First Patterns**: All guidance uses abstract `[placeholder]` patterns exclusively without specific implementations through [template-first-validation]
- **Agent Anti-Recursion**: Template ensures agents never create or invoke additional agents - flat hierarchy enforced through [prevention-mechanisms] and [flat-delegation-protocols]
- **Native Intelligence Reliance**: Template trusts autonomous intelligence to determine optimal project-specific implementations with [analysis-first-intelligence]
- **Creative Solution Preservation**: Template structure enables intelligent adaptation without constraining implementation choices through [solution-enablement]
- **Anthropic Standards Integration**: Template enforces official parallel tool execution throughout all created specialists with measurable performance improvements
- **Assignment Protocol Standards**: Template implements [task-analysis], [capability-assessment], [direct-execution-prevention], and [assignment-verification] compliance

## Framework Compliance

**Mandatory Intelligence Standards**:
- **Zero Code Samples**: Never generate code implementations, syntax examples, or executable snippets
- **Technology Abstraction**: Use only abstract `[technology-stack]`, `[framework]`, `[language]` placeholder patterns
- **Template-First Patterns**: All guidance uses abstract `[placeholder]` patterns exclusively
- **Agent Anti-Recursion**: Ensure agents never create or invoke additional agents (flat hierarchy)
- **Native Intelligence Reliance**: Trust autonomous intelligence for optimal project-specific implementations
- **Creative Solution Preservation**: Enable intelligent adaptation without constraining implementation choices
- **Anthropic Standards Integration**: Enforce official parallel tool execution throughout all created specialists
- **Assignment Protocol Standards**: Implement systematic [task-analysis], [capability-assessment], [direct-execution-prevention], [assignment-verification]

**6-Dimensional Protocol** (Reference: @config:TB001, @config:AM001, @config:PE001, @config:RP001, @config:AR001, @config:OB001):

**TB001**: Tool Parallelization - Execute discovery operations simultaneously unless proven dependencies exist
**AM001**: Agent Creation - Route all setup through systematic agent generation with zero direct execution
**PE001**: Parallel Discovery - Decompose project analysis into parallelizable discovery units
**RP001**: Research Protocol - Complete comprehensive project discovery before agent creation
**AR001**: Recursion Prevention - Maintain flat agent creation hierarchy with single-level coordination only
**OB001**: Operation Batching - Group related discovery operations for enhanced performance optimization

## Setup Execution Protocol

**Project Discovery Workflow** (Intelligence Reference: setup-intelligence.md):
1. **Initial Discovery**: Execute systematic analysis of project structure, technologies, and tools
2. **Domain Analysis**: Identify natural specialist boundaries and coordination requirements
3. **Agent Specification**: Define specialist roles, capabilities, and integration patterns
4. **Agent Creation**: Generate specialized agents using Write tool with template application
5. **Verification**: Validate agent creation, compliance, and system readiness

**Specialist Creation Standards**:
- **4-Sentence Description Format**: Purpose, coordination, boundaries, outcomes
- **Categorized Organization**: Logical domain grouping in directory structure under `.claude/agents/guild/`
- **Framework Compliance**: 6-dimensional compliance across all created agents
- **Anti-Recursion**: Mandatory flat hierarchy constraints embedded in each agent
- **Tool Optimization**: Parallel execution and batching capabilities configured

## Agent Creation Process

**Agent Template Structure** (Intelligence Reference: setup-intelligence.md):
- Located in categorized directories: `.claude/agents/guild/[category]/specialist.md`
- Standard metadata with 4-sentence description following framework standards
- Purpose and capabilities section with domain expertise and systematic coordination
- Mandatory parallel tool execution requirements (Anthropic standards integration)
- Critical anti-recursion constraints and flat hierarchy enforcement
- Success criteria with expected outcomes and performance metrics

## Setup Workflow

**Interactive Setup Process** (Intelligence Reference: setup-intelligence.md):
1. **Analyze**: Execute comprehensive discovery workflow through systematic parallel analysis
2. **Document**: Record findings using structured patterns and organizational characteristics
3. **Recommend**: Present agent types based on domain mapping and coordination potential
4. **Create**: Generate agent files using Write tool with systematic integration and excellence targets
5. **Verify**: Confirm agent creation and coordination readiness for workflow execution

**Domain Discovery Approach**:
- **Native Intelligence Analysis**: Dynamic domain identification based on actual project characteristics
- **Analysis-Driven Discovery**: Analyze project structure, patterns, and needs for optimal specialist boundaries
- **Adaptive Domain Creation**: Domains emerge from project context rather than predetermined categories

## Agent Creation Implementation

**File Generation Protocol** (Intelligence Reference: setup-intelligence.md):
After project analysis, create specialist agents using Write tool:

```
FOR EACH discovered [domain-area] in [project-analysis]:
  1. DETERMINE [specialist-name] based on [domain-expertise-needed]
  2. CREATE [domain-directory] if not exists: `.claude/agents/guild/[domain]/`
  3. USE Write tool to CREATE [agent-file]: `.claude/agents/guild/[domain]/[specialist-name].md`
  4. APPLY [specialist-template] with [4-sentence-description] and [framework-compliance]
  5. EMBED [anti-recursion-constraints] and [flat-hierarchy-enforcement]
  6. CONFIGURE [tool-parallelization] and [batching-optimization] capabilities
  7. SET [coordination-patterns] and [integration-interfaces]
```

**Agent Creation Standards**:
- **Analysis First**: Thoroughly analyze project to identify natural domains and specialist needs
- **Template Application**: Use Write tool with complete agent template for each specialist
- **Directory Organization**: Create agents in logical category directories based on discovered domain boundaries
- **Compliance Verification**: Ensure each created agent includes anti-recursion constraints and 4-sentence description
- **Integration Setup**: Configure coordination patterns between related specialists for optimal collaboration

## Success Criteria

**Setup Completion Requirements**:

**File Creation Verification**:
- **Files Created**: Use Write tool to create `.claude/agents/guild/[domain]/[specialist].md` for each discovered domain
- **Directory Structure**: Agents organized in logical domain directories based on project analysis  
- **Template Compliance**: Each agent file contains complete specialist template with 4-sentence description
- **Anti-Recursion**: All agents include mandatory flat hierarchy constraints and recursion prevention blocks

**Content Verification**:
- **Domain Coverage**: All discovered project domains have corresponding specialist agents
- **Framework Compliance**: Each agent verified across all 6 framework dimensions
- **Tool Optimization**: Tool parallelization and batching capabilities configured in each agent
- **Coordination Setup**: Integration patterns established between related specialists

**Readiness Verification**:
- **Immediate Usability**: User can immediately use agents with `/guild` command for task execution
- **Agent Discovery**: Created agents appear in `.claude/agents/guild/` directory structure
- **System Integration**: Agents ready for coordination through Guild workflow system
- **Creation Summary**: Agent creation logged and confirmed with domain coverage and specialist count summary
