description: "Analyze [project-type] and create specialized agents based on discovered needs"
---

## Purpose
Initialize Guild system by analyzing project structure and creating specialized agents based on discovered project needs through systematic discovery and intelligent agent generation.

## User Request Processing

When $ARGUMENTS is provided, treat it as the user's specific request that guides this setup:
- Process $ARGUMENTS as primary task instructions that modify setup approach
- Adapt setup workflow based on user intent and requirements  
- Apply intelligent reasoning to determine optimal specialist needs for the request
- Allow $ARGUMENTS to override default behaviors when user intent is clear

## Project Discovery Intelligence

**Philosophy**: Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes structure.

EXECUTE setup operations through [project-discovery-intelligence] and [agent-generation-protocols] with systematic dimensional integration (Reference: @config:TB001, @config:AM001, @config:PE001, @config:RP001, @config:AR001, @config:OB001).

**ARCHITECTURAL BOUNDARY**: Creates agents with embedded parallel capabilities, NEVER executes them. Setup = Agent Factory.

COORDINATE systematic [project-analysis] through [parallel-discovery-patterns] and [technology-stack-assessment].

APPLY project intelligence through abstract patterns:

### Discovery Framework
- **EXECUTE** comprehensive [project-structure-analysis] through [systematic-scanning] and [parallel-exploration-frameworks]
- **COORDINATE** simultaneous [technology-identification], [framework-detection], and [tool-capability-assessment] 
- **CHALLENGE** sequential [discovery-assumptions] through [dependency-verification-frameworks]
- **OPTIMIZE** discovery performance through [parallel-tool-execution] and [batching-optimization]

### Analysis Intelligence
- **APPLY** [technology-stack-profiling] through [parallel-component-analysis] and [systematic-assessment-protocols]
- **COORDINATE** [dependency-mapping], [architecture-discovery], and [complexity-evaluation] simultaneously
- **EXECUTE** [domain-boundary-identification] through [pattern-analysis] and [specialization-assessment]
- **VERIFY** [project-characteristics] through [cross-dimensional-validation] and [evidence-based-analysis]

## Framework Compliance

<!-- INTELLIGENCE_EMBEDDING_PLACEHOLDER:FRAMEWORK_COMPLIANCE -->
<!-- This placeholder will be replaced by install.js with framework compliance intelligence -->

## Setup-Specific Tool Coordination

COORDINATE [setup-tools] through [parallel-execution-mandate] and [discovery-optimization].

### Discovery Tool Patterns
- **EXECUTE** [file-system-scanning], [configuration-detection], and [dependency-analysis] simultaneously
- **BATCH** [project-structure-analysis], [technology-discovery], and [tool-inventory-compilation] for [efficiency-optimization]
- **CHALLENGE** [sequential-discovery-assumptions] through [systematic-parallelization-assessment]
- **OPTIMIZE** [discovery-performance] through [resource-coordination] and [batching-intelligence]

### Tool Selection Intelligence
- **COORDINATE** [discovery-capability-matching] with [project-analysis-requirements] through [systematic-assessment]
- **PRIORITIZE** [parallel-execution-tools] for [simultaneous-discovery-operations] and [performance-enhancement]
- **BALANCE** [scanning-speed] with [analysis-depth] through [intelligent-resource-allocation]
- **INTEGRATE** [tool-results] through [parallel-coordination] and [comprehensive-synthesis]

## Agent Generation Intelligence

ORCHESTRATE [specialist-creation] through [systematic-generation-protocols] and [template-compliance-frameworks].

### Agent Architecture Patterns
- **CREATE** [domain-specialist-agents] through [4-sentence-description-standards] and [capability-specification]
- **EMBED** [parallel-tool-execution-prompts] through [Anthropic-standards-integration] during [agent-creation]
- **ORGANIZE** [agent-structure] through [category-directory-structure] and [domain-boundary-alignment]
- **APPLY** [anti-recursion-constraints] through [flat-hierarchy-enforcement] and [prevention-mechanisms]
- **NEVER** [execute-agents] or [coordinate-runtime-operations] - creation-only boundary

### Generation Framework
- **ANALYZE** [project-domains] through [specialization-requirements-assessment] and [coordination-needs-evaluation]
- **CREATE** [specialist-agents] through [template-application] and [framework-compliance-validation]
- **ORGANIZE** [agent-structure] through [logical-categorization] and [domain-specific-directories]
- **VERIFY** [creation-completeness] through [coverage-assessment] and [readiness-validation]

## Setup-Specific Chain-of-Thought Patterns

APPLY [setup-thinking-intelligence] through [analytical-decomposition] and [discovery-transparency].

### Setup Reasoning Framework
- **BREAK** [project-analysis-tasks] into [sequential-discovery-steps] through [decomposition-intelligence]
- **EXPOSE** [discovery-reasoning] through [visible-analysis-patterns] and [decision-logic-transparency]
- **VALIDATE** [project-assumptions] through [systematic-challenge-protocols] and [evidence-verification]
- **CONNECT** [analysis-components] through [logical-discovery-chains] and [evidence-integration]

### Setup Thinking Patterns
```
<thinking>
1. [Project-component-analysis]: [technology-stack-reasoning] and [architecture-evidence]
2. [Domain-identification]: [specialization-reasoning] and [boundary-evidence]
3. [Agent-specification]: [creation-reasoning] and [coordination-evidence]
4. [Integration-planning]: [coordination-reasoning] and [readiness-synthesis]
</thinking>
```

## Setup Verification

CONFIRM [setup-completion] through [systematic-assessment] and [readiness-validation].

### Completion Criteria
- **Project Discovery Complete**: [Technology-stack], [architecture-patterns], and [domain-boundaries] comprehensively analyzed
- **Agent Generation Complete**: All [discovered-domains] have corresponding [specialist-agents] with [framework-compliance]
- **System Integration Ready**: [Agent-coordination-patterns] established and [workflow-readiness] verified
- **Quality Standards Met**: [Template-compliance], [anti-recursion-constraints], and [parallel-execution-standards] validated

### Excellence Targets
- **Discovery Excellence**: [Comprehensive-coverage] through [parallel-analysis] and [systematic-assessment]
- **Generation Excellence**: [Agent-quality] through [4-sentence-standards] and [framework-dimensional-compliance]
- **Coordination Excellence**: [Integration-readiness] through [specialist-coordination-patterns] and [workflow-preparation]
- **Performance Excellence**: [Setup-efficiency] through [parallel-execution] and [optimization-measurement]
