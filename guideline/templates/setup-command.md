## Setup Execution Protocol

### Phase 1: Project Analysis (ULTRATHINK)

**CRITICAL**: Use embedded intelligence above for all analysis and decision-making.

1. **Project Structure Analysis**
   - Analyze directory structure, configuration files, and architectural patterns
   - Identify technology stack using embedded detection intelligence
   - Assess project complexity and sophistication level

2. **Dynamic Pattern Detection**
   - Use Claude's natural understanding to identify project patterns
   - Detect technology specializations through intelligent analysis
   - Recognize quality standards and testing approaches from context

3. **Specialist Agent Planning**
   - Generate specialist agents based on detected patterns (not hardcoded templates)
   - Plan parallel execution with hierarchical coordination
   - Design agent specializations for workflow optimization

### Phase 2: Agent Generation

**MANDATORY DIRECTORY**: All Guild agents MUST be created in `$PROJECT_ROOT/.claude/agents/guild/` subdirectory.

Generate specialized agents using prompt-first pattern detection and dynamic analysis:

#### Planning Router (Master Orchestrator)
```yaml
guild-planning-router.md:
  thinking_mode: think-harder
  model: opus
  role: Master orchestration, task decomposition, and hierarchical agent coordination
  instructions: Think harder about task decomposition and agent coordination strategies.
  constraints: NEVER make direct changes, orchestrate through domain leads only
```

#### Dynamic Specialist Agents (Implementation)
```yaml
# Generated based on project analysis - ALL USE THINK MODE ONLY:
guild-[domain]-lead.md:
  thinking_mode: think
  model: inherit
  role: [Domain] domain lead with sub-agent spawning capability
  specialization: [Domain-specific] coordination
  instructions: Think through [domain] architecture and coordination.
  sub_agent_spawning: Can spawn 2-3 sub-agents when 3+ similar tasks
```

### Phase 3: Instructions File Creation

Create `$PROJECT_ROOT/.guild/instructions.md` with:

1. **Agent Specialization Configuration**
   - Detected technology patterns and specialist routing rules
   - Dynamic agent creation based on project analysis
   - Enhanced concurrency with adaptive scaling

2. **Workflow Integration**
   - Reasoning with approach verification
   - Prompt-first pattern detection and analysis
   - Quality standards based on project conventions

3. **Plain English Instructions**
   - Simple, clear rules that all agents must follow
   - Project-specific adaptations and requirements
   - Single source of truth for all Guild behavior

### Phase 4: Validation & Completion

1. **Verify Agent Placement**: Confirm all agents created in `$PROJECT_ROOT/.claude/agents/guild/` directory
2. **Test Context Flow**: Validate coordination protocols
3. **Integration Check**: Ensure seamless integration with existing project workflows

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All Guild agents created in `$PROJECT_ROOT/.claude/agents/guild/` directory (MANDATORY)
- ✅ Planning router properly configured with hierarchical coordination
- ✅ Domain lead agents configured with sub-agent spawning capabilities
- ✅ Project-specific instructions created in `$PROJECT_ROOT/.guild/instructions.md`
- ✅ Coordination protocols established
- ✅ Zero external dependencies - complete self-contained operation
