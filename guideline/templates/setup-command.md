## Purpose
Initialize Guild system by analyzing project structure and preparing agent creation specifications through systematic discovery. Preparation only - execution is handled by workflow command.

## Systematic Analysis & Preparation Process

**Project Analysis for Agent Preparation:**
Comprehensive project analysis to determine optimal agent specifications through systematic discovery:

### Initial Project Discovery

**Preparation-Focused Analysis:**
Reference: `@config:AG001` (Agent Creation Pattern), `@config:RP001` (Research Pattern)
- Execute systematic discovery for comprehensive project understanding
- Parallel analysis of project technologies and frameworks
- Map project structure through coordinated exploration
- Assess complexity areas requiring specialized assistance
- Document findings for intelligent agent creation specifications

**Discovery Coordination:**
Reference: `@config:EX001` (Execution Pattern)
- Parallel execution of project configuration and dependency analysis
- Simultaneous codebase structure scanning
- Coordinated testing framework and build tool identification
- Parallel architectural pattern mapping

## Comprehensive Project Discovery

**Initialization Analysis:**
Reference: `@config:RP001` (Research Pattern)

Gather information through systematic exploration to prepare agent specifications:
- **Technology Stack Analysis**: Comprehensive framework and dependency discovery
- **Project Structure Mapping**: Architectural organization analysis
- **Domain Boundaries**: Identify natural specialist focus areas
- **Complexity Assessment**: Determine areas requiring specialized agent assistance
- **Performance Profiling**: Categorize project components by complexity requirements

## Specialist Creation Standards

**4-Sentence Description Format:**
Reference: `@config:AG001` (Agent Creation Pattern)
1. **Purpose**: What the specialist does, core capabilities, and systematic integration
2. **Coordination**: How it works with others using established patterns and when to use
3. **Boundaries**: Important limitations, recovery patterns, and error handling
4. **Outcomes**: Expected results, integration patterns, and excellence targets

## Organization Structure

**Agents organized by discovered domains:**
```
.claude/agents/guild/
├── [domain-1]/     # e.g., frontend, backend
│   └── specialist.md
├── [domain-2]/     # e.g., testing, security  
│   └── specialist.md
└── [domain-N]/     # Based on project analysis
    └── specialist.md
```

**Categories determined by:**
- Project technologies and architecture
- Natural domain boundaries
- Workflow patterns discovered

## Specialist Template

```markdown
---
name: [domain]-specialist
model: inherit  
thinking_mode: ultrathink
description: "[4-sentence description following framework standards with systematic integration]"
---

## Purpose
[Specialized role and domain expertise with systematic coordination]

## Capabilities
**Core Skills**: [Domain-specific abilities and expertise areas]
**Integration**: [How it coordinates with other specialists using established patterns]
**Quality Standards**: [Error handling, recovery patterns, and verification approach]
**Performance**: [Excellence targets and coordination strategies]

## Success Criteria
[Expected outcomes, deliverables, excellence targets, and performance metrics for this domain]
```

## Interactive Process

Reference: `@config:EX001` (Execution Pattern), `@config:RP001` (Research Pattern)

1. **Analyze**: Execute comprehensive discovery workflow through systematic analysis
2. **Document**: Record findings using structured patterns and organizational characteristics
3. **Recommend**: Present agent types based on domain mapping and coordination potential
4. **Specify**: User confirms agents with systematic integration and excellence targets
5. **Hand-off**: Provide specifications to workflow command with coordination patterns

## Capability Domains

**Common domains discovered:**
- **Technical**: Frontend, backend, database, API layers
- **Quality**: Testing, security, performance, code quality
- **Operations**: Deployment, monitoring, infrastructure
- **Maintenance**: Documentation, refactoring, dependency management

**User-driven creation**: Specify which domains need agents and their focus areas.

## Preparation Examples

**Project Analysis Process:**
Reference: `@config:RP001` (Research Pattern), `@config:EX001` (Execution Pattern)

**Analysis Approach:**
```
<analysis_phase>
  <!-- Systematic Discovery Pattern -->
  <!-- Phase 1: Project Structure Discovery -->
  <discover_project_structure>[project-path]</discover_project_structure>
  <identify_technologies>patterns and frameworks</identify_technologies>
  <map_dependencies>relationships and requirements</map_dependencies>
  <assess_complexity>areas requiring specialized attention</assess_complexity>
  
  <!-- Phase 2: Domain and Pattern Analysis -->
  <analyze_architecture>structural organization</analyze_architecture>
  <identify_patterns>conventions and practices</identify_patterns>
  <map_domains>natural specialist boundaries</map_domains>
  
  <!-- Document findings for agent specification -->
  <!-- Prepare recommendations with coordination analysis -->
</analysis_phase>
```

**Specification Preparation:**

**Analysis Template:**
```
Discovered Stack: [frameworks] + [languages] + [build-tools] + [testing-setup]
Project Structure: [directories] + [patterns] + [conventions] + [complexity]
Agent Recommendations: [specialist-types] + [focus-areas] + [domain-boundaries] 
Integration Patterns: [coordination-strategies] + [collaboration-points] + [excellence-targets]
```

**Preparation Philosophy:**
- Execute systematic discovery workflows to understand optimal specialists
- Document findings with structural patterns and coordination recommendations for user review
- Prepare specifications with excellence targets but defer actual agent creation to workflow execution
- Focus on thorough analysis to enable informed agent creation decisions

## Best Practices

Reference: `@config:AG001` (Agent Creation Pattern), `@config:CS001` (Coordination Strategy)

- Execute comprehensive discovery workflows before recommending agents
- Create agents with clear specializations and coordination boundaries
- Design for systematic coordination between agents with performance optimization
- Include recovery patterns and proper error handling in each agent
- Organize agents logically by domain with compatible coordination strategies
- Focus on user needs rather than maximum coverage
- Leverage coordination patterns for optimal agent collaboration design
- Integrate excellence targets into all agent specifications

## Preparation Verification

**After analysis, verify:**
- All project domains identified using systematic discovery
- Recommended agent types match discovered complexity
- Specifications include necessary domain coverage with excellence targets
- User approves recommended agent configuration
- Analysis complete with coordination mapping to enable effective agent creation
- Clear hand-off prepared for workflow command execution with recovery patterns
- Excellence targets integrated into all agent specifications
- Coordination patterns documented for optimal agent collaboration

**Intelligence Sources**: Project analysis patterns, domain identification protocols, specification preparation standards, systematic coordination frameworks
**Core Integration**: Systematic analysis framework, preparation protocols with excellence targets, user interaction patterns with intelligent coordination
**Approach**: Execute discovery workflows to analyze project characteristics and prepare specifications with systematic excellence
**Scope Limitation**: PREPARATION ONLY - No agent creation, orchestration, or execution (handled by workflow command with coordination patterns and recovery integration)
