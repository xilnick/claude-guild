## Command Entry Point
ultrathink $ARGUMENTS

<critical>
MANDATORY: Use Task tool for ALL work delegation. Never execute directly.
MANDATORY: Default to parallel execution unless explicit dependencies exist.
MANDATORY: Create specialists based on evidence, not assumptions.
MANDATORY: Generated agents MUST use ONLY [placeholder] patterns - NO specific examples or code structures.
</critical>

<purpose>
Initialize Guild system through evidence-based project discovery → specialist identification → abstracted agent creation → usage documentation workflow.
</purpose>

## Execution Framework

<system_design>
<principle>Discover project characteristics → Route specialist creation to Task tool → Generate abstracted agents → Report results</principle>
<execution>Parallel-first discovery, evidence-based analysis, systematic delegation, complete abstraction</execution>
</system_design>

<phase_1 name="discovery" mode="parallel_execution">

**DELEGATE ALL DISCOVERY TO TASK TOOL**

<discovery_operations>
Use Task tool to execute in parallel:
- **File Structure Analysis**: [project_organization], [component_architecture], [structural_patterns]
- **Technology Identification**: [discovered_frameworks], [detected_languages], [identified_tooling]
- **Pattern Discovery**: [code_conventions], [naming_patterns], [testing_approaches]
- **Convention Detection**: [build_systems], [deployment_configurations], [documentation_standards]
</discovery_operations>

<discovery_constraints>
- MUST use parallel tool execution for all independent operations
- MUST delegate discovery work through Task tool
- MUST collect evidence before making assumptions
- MUST document all findings with [placeholder] abstractions
</discovery_constraints>

</phase_1>

<phase_2 name="analysis">

**Identify Required Specialists Based on Discovery Evidence**

<specialist_categories>
- **Domain Experts**: [discovered_architecture_layers] specialists
- **Technology Specialists**: [identified_tech_stack] experts  
- **Task Specialists**: [detected_workflow_needs] automation
- **Project-Specific**: [unique_project_characteristics] handlers
</specialist_categories>

<analysis_criteria>
- Base on actual [project_evidence], not generic assumptions
- Match specialist expertise to [discovered_needs]
- Consider [workload_distribution] and [specialization_depth]
- Identify [cross_cutting_concerns] requiring coordination
</analysis_criteria>

</phase_2>

<phase_3 name="creation">

**DELEGATE AGENT CREATION TO TASK TOOL**

<abstracted_agent_generation>
Each generated specialist MUST contain ONLY:

1. **Proper YAML Frontmatter**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: [derived_specialist_name]
   model: inherit
   thinking_mode: ultrathink
   description: "[abstract_role_description] specialist for [project_context_type]"
   ---
   ```

2. **Abstracted Role Definition**:
   "You are a [specialist_expertise] specialist working on [project_type] following [discovered_conventions]. Your role focuses on [capability_area] while collaborating with [related_specialists] to achieve [project_objectives]."

3. **Abstract Capability Statement**:
   "Key responsibilities include [responsibility_patterns] and maintaining [quality_standards] throughout [work_scope]."

</abstracted_agent_generation>

<absolute_prohibitions>
❌ NO concrete XML structures or code examples
❌ NO specific file paths, technology names, or implementation details
❌ NO prescriptive content beyond [placeholder] patterns
❌ NO "how-to" guidance or implementation examples
❌ NO specific project references outside [placeholder] format
</absolute_prohibitions>

<creation_requirements>
- Save ALL agents to: ./.claude/agents/guild/ (MANDATORY)
- Embed [discovered_project_patterns] in abstracted form only
- Keep agents focused through [abstract_boundaries]
- Include [collaboration_protocols] in placeholder form
- Generate minimum viable abstracted content only
- NEVER persist concrete examples or implementations
- Agent templates only - no saved examples
- MANDATORY directory: ./.claude/agents/guild/ 
- ALWAYS use guild subdirectory for all generated agents
</creation_requirements>

</phase_3>

<phase_4 name="reporting">

**Display Created Specialists and Usage Guidance (EPHEMERAL - NO PERSISTENCE)**

<reporting_structure>
MANDATORY: Reports are ephemeral - display only, never save
1. **Specialist Inventory**: List created agents with [expertise_areas] (display only)
2. **Discovery Summary**: Key [project_characteristics] found (display only)
3. **Usage Patterns**: How to leverage [specialist_capabilities] (display only)
4. **Integration Guidance**: [coordination_protocols] between specialists (display only)
</reporting_structure>

</phase_4>

## Verification Framework

<verification_streams>
1. **Abstraction Compliance**: All agents use ONLY [placeholder] patterns
2. **Frontmatter Validation**: Proper YAML structure with required fields
3. **Integration**: Agents can collaborate on [discovered_project_patterns]
4. **Completeness Check**: Verify all identified specialist needs are addressed
5. **No Persistence Verification**: Confirm no examples, reports, or concrete implementations were persisted
6. **Ephemeral State Confirmation**: Verify all working memory was cleared after completion
7. **Guild Directory Verification**: Confirm all agents saved to ./.claude/agents/guild/
8. **User Approval**: Explicit confirmation of specialist roster and capabilities
</verification_streams>

## Implementation Protocol

<workflow_execution>
<task>DELEGATE to Task tool: Parallel project discovery using [discovery_methods]</task>
<context>Analyze [current_project] structure and [project_characteristics]</context>  
<requirements>Evidence-based specialist identification and abstracted agent creation</requirements>
</workflow_execution>

<user_request_processing>
If user specifies additional specialists:
1. Perform complete project discovery FIRST via Task tool
2. Create evidence-based specialists from [discovery_results]
3. ADD user-requested specialists to the [evidence_based_roster]
4. Report complete [specialist_ecosystem]
</user_request_processing>

<anti_patterns>
❌ Direct execution without Task tool delegation
❌ Sequential operations when parallel execution possible
❌ Creating specialists based on assumptions vs [evidence_patterns]
❌ Generic specialists without [project_context] embedding
❌ Including specific examples or code structures in generated agents
❌ Using concrete references instead of [placeholder] abstractions
❌ Persisting examples, reports, or concrete implementations
❌ Saving working state or scratchpad data to files
</anti_patterns>

<critical>
SUCCESS PATTERN: Use Task tool → Parallel discovery → Evidence analysis → Abstracted specialist creation → Verification → User approval

KEY CONSTRAINTS:
- ALWAYS delegate work through Task tool
- ALWAYS use parallel execution for independent operations
- ALWAYS base specialists on [discovered_project_evidence]
- ALWAYS embed [discovered_patterns] in abstracted placeholder form
- ALWAYS save to ./.claude/agents/guild/ (MANDATORY path)
- NEVER include concrete examples or specific implementations in generated agents
