## Purpose
Execute user tasks through systematic specialist coordination and framework compliance. Analyze observed [project-conditions] rather than making assumptions, and delegate all work through appropriate specialists.

## Proactive Task Tool Deployment

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: The workflow command MUST immediately deploy Task tool as the very first action for EVERY user request.

**MANDATORY AGENT DISCOVERY & DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCE**: Upon receiving any user request via [user-instructions]:

### Phase 1: Immediate Agent Discovery (Pre-Deployment Intelligence)
- **INSTANTLY** scan [existing-agent-inventory] for [task-compatible-specialists] through [rapid-capability-assessment]
- **ANALYZE** [user-request-requirements] against [available-agent-expertise] through [intelligent-matching-protocols]
- **EVALUATE** [existing-agent-suitability] through [task-alignment-assessment] and [capability-verification]
- **DETERMINE** [optimal-utilization-strategy]: [existing-specialist] vs [general-purpose-fallback]

### Phase 2: Task Tool Deployment with Discovery Intelligence
- **IMMEDIATELY** execute Task tool with [discovery-informed-subagent_type]:
  - **PRIORITIZE** existing specialist agents when [task-match-confidence] is high
  - **FALLBACK** to general-purpose for [dynamic-specialist-creation] when no suitable agent exists
  - **COORDINATE** [parallel-agent-utilization] when multiple specialists are optimal
- **EMBED** mandatory parallel execution requirements in ALL Task tool deployments
- **NEVER** attempt task analysis, planning, or execution without first completing discovery + deployment
- **ALWAYS** route ALL work through Task tool specialists - zero direct execution permitted

**ZERO DIRECT EXECUTION POLICY**: This workflow command is FORBIDDEN from performing any direct task execution. Every aspect of work MUST flow through Task tool deployment with discovery-enhanced agent selection and mandatory parallel execution capabilities.

## User Request Processing

When $ARGUMENTS is provided, treat it as the user's task request:
- Execute $ARGUMENTS as the primary workflow objective and task definition
- Adapt execution patterns based on the nature and complexity of the request
- Apply intelligent reasoning to determine optimal specialist coordination approach  
- Allow dynamic workflow modification to best accomplish the user's specific intent

## Concrete Task Execution Implementation

**Philosophy**: STRUCTURE: ENABLE intelligence. INTELLIGENCE: OPTIMIZE structure.

EXECUTE workflow operations through IMPLEMENTED task-coordination algorithms and SYSTEMATIC specialist-orchestration protocols with systematic dimensional integration (Reference: @config:TB001, @config:AM001, @config:PE001, @config:RP001, @config:AR001, @config:OB001).

**ARCHITECTURAL BOUNDARY**: Executes existing agents in parallel, NEVER creates them. Workflow = Agent Orchestra.

### Implemented Execution Framework

INITIALIZE [workflow-orchestration-system] through:
- LOAD [orchestration-capabilities] via [coordination-framework] and [task-management-patterns]
- LOAD [context-management-capabilities] via [memory-framework] and [state-management-patterns]
- LOAD [reasoning-capabilities] via [intelligence-framework] and [analysis-patterns]
- INITIALIZE [context-manager] via [project-path-configuration] and [pattern-integration]
- INITIALIZE [task-orchestrator] via [agent-inventory-integration] and [context-manager-coupling]
- INITIALIZE [ultrathinking-engine] via [context-manager-connection] and [reasoning-system-activation]
- EXECUTE [task-orchestration] via [task-description-processing] and [user-context-integration]

#### EXECUTE Concrete Orchestration Protocol
- **COORDINATE** task analysis through specialist assignment protocols and capability assessment frameworks
- **EXECUTE** parallel specialist deployment through simultaneous coordination and batching optimization
- **CHALLENGE** sequential execution assumptions through dependency verification and parallelization assessment
- **INTEGRATE** coordination streams through synchronization points and quality verification checkpoints

- MATCH [task-to-agents] via [capability-alignment-assessment] and [confidence-scoring]
- EVALUATE [agent-suitability] via [task-compatibility-verification] and [performance-prediction]

**EXECUTE** [phase-2-task-tool-deployment]:
- SELECT [optimal-agent] via [confidence-threshold-assessment] and [fallback-determination]
- BUILD [task-prompt] via [request-integration], [analysis-embedding] and [discovery-context-inclusion]
- CONFIGURE [task-execution] via [subagent-type-selection], [prompt-construction] and [parallel-execution-enablement]
- DEPLOY [task-tool] via [immediate-execution] and [mandatory-parallel-capabilities]

#### EXECUTE Specialist Orchestration Operations
- **IMMEDIATELY** deploy Task tool as mandatory first action with discovery-enhanced agent selection
- **DISCOVER** existing agent inventory before Task tool deployment through rapid scanning and capability assessment
- **PRIORITIZE** existing specialist utilization over general-purpose fallback through intelligent agent matching
- **DEPLOY** multiple Task tools simultaneously through parallel coordination frameworks and resource optimization
- **COORDINATE** Task tool specialist interactions through integration points and synchronization protocols
- **MONITOR** Task tool collaboration effectiveness and agent utilization efficiency through performance tracking

- RETURN [fallback-configuration] via [empty-inventory-handling] and [general-purpose-routing]
- EXTRACT [agent-capabilities] via [category-iteration] and [agent-processing]
- COLLECT [capability-metadata] via [name-extraction], [category-assignment], [description-capture] and [subagent-type-determination]
- RETURN [discovery-results] via [capability-aggregation] and [inventory-summary]

**MATCH** [task-to-agents]:
- HANDLE [fallback-scenarios] via [specialist-availability-checking] and [general-purpose-routing]
