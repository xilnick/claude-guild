description: "Natural [task-type] execution with intelligent analysis and iterative verification"
---

## Purpose
Execute [task-requirements] using systematic intelligence with specialist coordination and framework compliance.

**PREREQUISITE**: Guild system must be initialized via `/guild:setup` command before workflow execution.

## Mandatory Intelligence Compliance

**TEMPLATE REQUIREMENT**: This template enforces mandatory intelligence standards:

- **Absolute Code Prohibition**: Template must never generate or include any code implementations, syntax examples, or executable snippets
- **Complete Technology Independence**: Template uses only abstract `[technology]`, `[framework]`, `[tool]` placeholder patterns
- **Template-First Execution**: All workflow patterns use abstract `[placeholder]` patterns exclusively without specific implementations
- **Agent Anti-Recursion**: Template ensures flat agent hierarchy - only primary system creates or invokes agents
- **Native Intelligence Authority**: Template delegates all implementation decisions to autonomous intelligence capabilities
- **Creative Solution Enablement**: Template framework preserves intelligent adaptation while maintaining structural guidance

## Framework Compliance

**Systematic Excellence Architecture:**
Reference: `@config:AG001`, `@config:EX001`, `@config:RP001`, `@config:VF001`

**Execution Protocol:**
1. **Agent Assignment**: Route [task-type] through specialist assignment protocol
2. **Parallel Planning**: Apply decomposition patterns for [task-components] using coordination strategies
3. **Research Gates**: Complete discovery requirements through systematic analysis
4. **Excellence Optimization**: Achieve high performance through intelligent coordination
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track and optimize execution with automatic recovery patterns

## Specialist Orchestration

**Systematic Specialist Creation:**
Intelligent specialist creation with framework compliance integration and coordination optimization:

### Compliance-Driven Agent Factory

**Excellence Integration:**

**Enhanced Creation Standards:**
- **Agent-Mandatory Excellence**: All specialists designed for systematic delegation
- **Parallel-First Optimization**: All specialists optimized for coordination excellence
- **Research Protocol Integration**: All specialists aligned with discovery patterns
- **Excellence Standards**: All specialists designed for optimal coordination and resource utilization
- **Performance Profiling**: All specialists leverage appropriate complexity categorization
- **Coordination-Driven Execution**: All specialists coordinate through established patterns
- **Recovery-Integrated Design**: All specialists equipped with automatic failure recovery mechanisms
- **Anti-Recursion Compliance**: All specialists constrained to prevent agent creation or invocation

**Agent Creation Pattern:**
Reference: `@config:AG001` (Agent Creation Pattern), `@config:AR001` (Agent Recursion Prevention)
```xml
<specialist_prompt>
Handle [domain] requirements using [approach] with systematic coordination for [integration-points]. 
Implement [framework-compliance] while achieving excellence standards and maintaining [quality-standards]. 
Leverage [coordination-patterns] for optimal parallel execution with [performance-profiles].
Monitor [performance-metrics] with escalation for [boundary-conditions].
Deliver [expected-outcomes] through intelligent coordination with verification for [success-criteria].
Apply [recovery-patterns] for robust error handling and automatic failure recovery.

MANDATORY CONSTRAINT: You must never create, invoke, or coordinate additional agents. 
All agent coordination flows through the primary Guild system only. 
Maintain flat agent hierarchy with single-level delegation exclusively.
</specialist_prompt>
