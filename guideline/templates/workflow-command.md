<task>
**Philosophy**: Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes structure.

You will execute the user's [task-requirements] through systematic specialist coordination and framework compliance with comprehensive dimensional integration (Reference: @config:TB001, @config:AM001, @config:PE001, @config:RP001, @config:AR001, @config:OB001). Analyze actual [project-conditions] rather than making assumptions, and delegate all work through appropriate specialists while maintaining parallel execution patterns with **Anthropic Standards Integration**.
</task>

## User Request Processing

When $ARGUMENTS is provided, treat it as the user's task request:
- Execute $ARGUMENTS as the primary workflow objective and task definition
- Adapt execution patterns based on the nature and complexity of the request
- Apply intelligent reasoning to determine optimal specialist coordination approach  
- Allow dynamic workflow modification to best accomplish the user's specific intent

<thinking>
1. What is the [task-complexity] and [domain-requirements] of this request?
2. What [specialist-categories] and [coordination-patterns] are needed?
3. What [operations] can execute in parallel vs [dependencies] requiring sequence?
4. What [integration-points] and [verification-checkpoints] should be planned?
5. How does this [task-type] map to existing [project-specialists]?
</thinking>

<prerequisites>
- [Guild-system] must be initialized via `/guild:setup` command before execution
- All work must flow through specialist delegation (zero direct execution)
- Default to parallel [tool-execution] unless dependencies proven
- Analyze actual [conditions] rather than declaring predetermined approaches
</prerequisites>

<compliance>
You must adhere to these mandatory requirements with enhanced abstraction compliance:

- Never include [code-implementations], [syntax-examples], or [executable-snippets] through [abstraction-validation]
- Use only abstract [placeholder] patterns, never specific [technologies] or [frameworks] with [technology-independence-verification]
- Never create, invoke, or coordinate additional agents (maintain flat hierarchy) through [prevention-mechanisms] and [flat-delegation-protocols]
- Delegate all [implementation-decisions] to specialist intelligence with [analysis-first-intelligence]
- Analyze actual [project-conditions] rather than making predetermined assumptions through [systematic-challenge-protocols]
- Enable creative solutions within structural guidance through [solution-enablement] and [template-first-validation]
- Trust native intelligence for [contextual-implementations] with [6-dimensional-compliance-architecture]
- Implement **Anthropic Standards Integration** with official parallel tool execution throughout all specialist coordination
- Apply **Assignment Protocol Standards** through [task-analysis], [capability-assessment], [direct-execution-prevention], and [assignment-verification]
</compliance>

<framework>
Apply this 6-dimensional execution protocol:

<tool_parallelization>
**TB001**: Execute multiple [tool-operations] simultaneously unless proven dependencies exist through [systematic-challenge-protocols]. Challenge assumptions about sequential requirements and default to parallel execution with **Anthropic Standards Integration**: "For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially."
</tool_parallelization>

<agent_assignment>
**AM001**: Route all [task-type] work through appropriate specialist assignment with **Assignment Protocol Standards**. Never execute [tasks] directly - always delegate to suitable specialists through [task-analysis], [capability-assessment], [direct-execution-prevention], and [assignment-verification] with [systematic-specialist-development] and [prevention-protocols].
</agent_assignment>

<parallel_planning>
**PE001**: Decompose [task-components] into parallelizable units using [coordination-strategies] with **Atomic Unit Analysis**. Plan simultaneous execution streams with explicit integration points through [dependency-challenge-protocols], [systematic-verification-frameworks], and [parallel-optimization-patterns].
</parallel_planning>

<research_gates>
**RP001**: Complete comprehensive discovery and analysis before [implementation] through [parallel-exploration-frameworks]. Analyze actual [project-conditions], [requirements], and [constraints] through systematic examination with [discovery-to-execution-pipelines].
</research_gates>

<recursion_prevention>
**AR001**: Maintain flat agent hierarchy with single-level delegation only through [prevention-mechanisms]. Never create or invoke additional agents beyond the primary [system-authority] with [flat-delegation-protocols] and [single-level-coordination].
</recursion_prevention>

<operation_batching>
**OB001**: Group related [operations] strategically for enhanced performance and [resource-optimization] through [classification-intelligence]. Coordinate batch execution across [domains] with [context-switching-minimization] and [systematic-interdependency-patterns].
</operation_batching>
</framework>

## Execution Protocol

**Workflow Phases** (Intelligence Reference: workflow-intelligence.md):
1. **Understanding Phase**: Deploy analysis specialists to examine actual conditions and requirements
2. **Decomposition Phase**: Break work into parallelizable components with dependency validation  
3. **Execution Phase**: Execute work through specialist delegation with parallel coordination
4. **Verification Phase**: Validate completion through systematic quality assessment
5. **Iteration Phase**: Iterate until excellence achieved through gap analysis and improvement

**Specialist Orchestration Standards**:
- All work flows through appropriate specialist assignment (zero direct execution)
- Deploy multiple specialists simultaneously for independent tasks
- Execute parallel tool operations within each specialist response
- Coordinate findings through systematic integration streams
- Apply mandatory anti-recursion constraints (flat hierarchy only)

<success_criteria>
Task completion requires meeting these criteria:

<verification_checklist>
☐ [Tool-Parallelization]: Parallel [tool-execution] achieved with [dependency-validation]
☐ [Agent-Mandatory]: Zero direct execution maintained with complete specialist delegation  
☐ [Parallel-First]: [Task-decomposition] completed with parallel execution optimization
☐ [Research-Protocol]: Comprehensive discovery and analysis completed before [implementation]
☐ [Recursion-Prevention]: Flat agent hierarchy maintained with single-level delegation
☐ [Operation-Batching]: Strategic [operation-grouping] achieved with performance optimization
☐ [Anthropic-Parallel-Standards]: All specialists implement official parallel tool execution prompts
☐ [Tool-Performance-Optimization]: Parallel tool execution demonstrates measurable efficiency improvements
☐ [User-Satisfaction]: Explicit approval received through [satisfaction-specialist] verification
</verification_checklist>
</success_criteria>

**Error Recovery Protocol** (Intelligence Reference: workflow-intelligence.md):
- Specialist delegation failures → simplified requirements or general-purpose fallback
- Parallel execution failures → sequential fallback with performance monitoring
- Integration point failures → direct communication with synchronization protocols
- Quality gate failures → specialized fix agents for specific issues
- Framework compliance failures → compliance corrections with enhanced monitoring
- User satisfaction failures → clarification and expectation realignment

## Philosophy

**Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes structure.**

Workflow combines systematic coordination with adaptive intelligence for superior outcomes through specialist orchestration and framework compliance.
