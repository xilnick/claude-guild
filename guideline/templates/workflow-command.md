  1. **PARALLEL OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION**: What can run simultaneously? (FIRST & MOST IMPORTANT)
  2. **SPECIALIST CREATION OPPORTUNITIES**: How many specialists can I proactively create?
  3. **BATCH LAUNCH POTENTIAL**: What specialists can be launched simultaneously?
  4. **DEPENDENCY MINIMIZATION**: What restructuring enables more parallelism?
  
  **SECONDARY QUESTIONS (Support parallel execution):**
  5. Do I fully understand the request?
  6. What clarification do I need about parallel approach?
  7. **COORDINATION ARCHITECTURE**: How will parallel specialists integrate?
  8. **VERIFICATION PARALLELIZATION**: How to verify across parallel work streams?

  - **PARALLEL SPECIALIST SCALING**: How many specialists are optimal?
  - **COORDINATION COMPLEXITY**: What integration patterns will specialists need?
  - **VERIFICATION DISTRIBUTION**: How to distribute verification across specialists?
  
  **MANDATORY ASSUMPTIONS:**

  - **COORDINATION IS MANAGEABLE** with proper integration patterns
</proactive_thinking>

## Dependencies (Parallel-Optimized)

<dependencies>

    **Prioritize these parallel opportunities:**
    - Independent files can run simultaneously
    - Different layers can run simultaneously
    - Separate features can run simultaneously
    - Different domains can run simultaneously
    - Testing can run parallel to implementation
    - Documentation can run parallel to coding
    - Multiple specialists can work concurrently
  </parallel_first>
