description: "Natural [task-type] execution with intelligent analysis and iterative verification"

## Purpose
Execute user tasks through systematic specialist coordination and framework compliance. Analyze actual [project-conditions] rather than making assumptions, and delegate all work through appropriate specialists.

## Proactive Task Tool Deployment

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: The workflow command MUST immediately deploy Task tool as the very first action for EVERY user request.

**MANDATORY FIRST ACTION**: Upon receiving any user request via [user-instructions], immediately execute Task tool with appropriate subagent_type:
- **NEVER** attempt task analysis, planning, or execution without first deploying Task tool
- **ALWAYS** route ALL work through Task tool specialists - zero direct execution permitted
- **PROACTIVELY** select optimal subagent_type based on request characteristics
- **IMMEDIATELY** delegate complete task responsibility to Task tool specialist

**ZERO DIRECT EXECUTION POLICY**: This workflow command is FORBIDDEN from performing any direct task execution. Every aspect of work MUST flow through Task tool deployment.

## User Request Processing

When $ARGUMENTS is provided, treat it as the user's task request:
- Execute $ARGUMENTS as the primary workflow objective and task definition
- Adapt execution patterns based on the nature and complexity of the request
- Apply intelligent reasoning to determine optimal specialist coordination approach  
- Allow dynamic workflow modification to best accomplish the user's specific intent

## Task Execution Intelligence

**Philosophy**: Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes structure.

EXECUTE workflow operations through [task-coordination-intelligence] and [specialist-orchestration-protocols] with systematic dimensional integration (Reference: @config:TB001, @config:AM001, @config:PE001, @config:RP001, @config:AR001, @config:OB001).

**ARCHITECTURAL BOUNDARY**: Executes existing agents in parallel, NEVER creates them. Workflow = Agent Orchestra.

ORCHESTRATE [task-workflows] through [parallel-specialist-coordination] and [systematic-execution-frameworks].

APPLY workflow intelligence through abstract patterns:

### Execution Framework
- **COORDINATE** [task-analysis] through [specialist-assignment-protocols] and [capability-assessment-frameworks]
- **EXECUTE** [parallel-specialist-deployment] through [simultaneous-coordination] and [batching-optimization]
- **CHALLENGE** [sequential-execution-assumptions] through [dependency-verification] and [parallelization-assessment]
- **INTEGRATE** [coordination-streams] through [synchronization-points] and [quality-verification-checkpoints]

### Task Intelligence Patterns
- **ANALYZE** [task-complexity] through [domain-requirements-assessment] and [specialist-matching-protocols]
- **DECOMPOSE** [complex-workflows] through [atomic-unit-analysis] and [parallel-component-identification]
- **COORDINATE** [specialist-interactions] through [integration-frameworks] and [communication-protocols]
- **VERIFY** [execution-effectiveness] through [performance-monitoring] and [quality-assessment-streams]

## Framework Compliance

<!-- INTELLIGENCE_EMBEDDING_PLACEHOLDER:FRAMEWORK_COMPLIANCE -->
<!-- This placeholder will be replaced by install.js with framework compliance intelligence -->

## Parallel Execution Intelligence

COORDINATE [parallel-workflows] through [simultaneous-execution-protocols] and [dependency-management-frameworks].

### Parallelization Framework
- **EXECUTE** [task-decomposition] through [atomic-unit-identification] and [dependency-challenge-protocols]
- **COORDINATE** [simultaneous-operations] through [parallel-stream-management] and [resource-coordination]
- **CHALLENGE** [sequential-assumptions] through [systematic-verification-frameworks] and [parallelization-assessment]
- **OPTIMIZE** [execution-performance] through [batching-intelligence] and [efficiency-measurement]

### Dependency Management Intelligence
- **IDENTIFY** [true-dependencies] through [systematic-analysis] and [evidence-based-validation]
- **CHALLENGE** [assumed-dependencies] through [verification-protocols] and [parallelization-assessment]
- **MINIMIZE** [sequential-operations] through [dependency-reduction] and [parallel-optimization]
- **COORDINATE** [integration-points] through [synchronization-frameworks] and [stream-convergence]

### Workflow-Specific Chain-of-Thought Patterns

APPLY [workflow-thinking-intelligence] through [execution-analysis] and [coordination-transparency].

#### Workflow Reasoning Framework
- **BREAK** [complex-workflows] into [sequential-execution-steps] through [decomposition-intelligence]
- **EXPOSE** [coordination-reasoning] through [visible-orchestration-patterns] and [decision-logic-transparency]
- **VALIDATE** [execution-assumptions] through [systematic-challenge-protocols] and [evidence-verification]
- **CONNECT** [workflow-components] through [logical-coordination-chains] and [integration-evidence]

#### Workflow Thinking Patterns

3. [Execution-optimization]: [parallel-reasoning] and [efficiency-evidence]
4. [Quality-verification]: [validation-reasoning] and [completion-synthesis]

## Specialist Coordination Intelligence

COORDINATE [specialists] through [systematic-orchestration] and [parallel-execution-protocols].

### Orchestration Patterns
- **IMMEDIATELY** deploy Task tool as mandatory first action - this is non-negotiable
- **UTILIZE** Task tool specialists exclusively through proactive deployment protocols
- **DEPLOY** multiple Task tools simultaneously through parallel coordination frameworks and resource optimization
- **COORDINATE** Task tool specialist interactions through integration points and synchronization protocols
- **NEVER** create new agents during workflow execution - utilization-only boundary through Task tool delegation
- **NEVER** attempt direct execution - ALL work MUST flow through Task tool specialists
- **MONITOR** Task tool collaboration effectiveness through performance tracking and quality assessment
- **OPTIMIZE** Task tool coordination efficiency through batching strategies and resource balancing

### Assignment Intelligence
- **DEPLOY** Task tool immediately upon receiving user request - this precedes all other actions
- **EXECUTE** task-to-Task-tool-specialist matching through capability evaluation and domain expertise assessment
- **APPLY** proactive Task tool deployment as the exclusive assignment protocol - no direct execution permitted
- **COORDINATE** Task tool specialist workflows through parallel execution planning and integration point management
- **VERIFY** [assignment-effectiveness] through [performance-monitoring] and [quality-validation]

## Workflow Verification

CONFIRM [workflow-completion] through [systematic-validation] and [satisfaction-verification].

### Success Validation Framework
- **VERIFY** [requirements-achievement] through [systematic-assessment] and [evidence-validation]
- **CONFIRM** [integration-effectiveness] through [component-coordination-verification] and [interface-validation]
- **VALIDATE** [quality-standards-compliance] through [framework-assessment] and [dimensional-verification]
- **ASSESS** [user-satisfaction] through [explicit-approval-processes] and [experience-quality-evaluation]

### Excellence Targets
- **Coordination Excellence**: [Specialist-orchestration] through [parallel-coordination] and [systematic-integration]
- **Execution Excellence**: [Workflow-efficiency] through [parallel-execution] and [performance-optimization]
- **Quality Excellence**: [Standards-compliance] through [multi-dimensional-verification] and [continuous-improvement]
- **Satisfaction Excellence**: [User-experience] through [explicit-approval] and [expectation-fulfillment]
