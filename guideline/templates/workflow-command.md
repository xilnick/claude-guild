description: "Natural [task-type] execution with intelligent analysis and iterative verification"
---

## Purpose
Execute [task-requirements] using systematic intelligence with specialist coordination and framework compliance.

**PREREQUISITE**: Guild system must be initialized via `/guild:setup` command before workflow execution.

## Mandatory Intelligence Compliance

**TEMPLATE REQUIREMENT**: This template enforces mandatory intelligence standards:

- **Absolute Code Prohibition**: Template must never generate or include any code implementations, syntax examples, or executable snippets
- **Complete Technology Independence**: Template uses only abstract `[technology]`, `[framework]`, `[tool]` placeholder patterns
- **Template-First Execution**: All workflow patterns use abstract `[placeholder]` patterns exclusively without specific implementations
- **Agent Anti-Recursion**: Template ensures flat agent hierarchy - only primary system creates or invokes agents
- **Native Intelligence Authority**: Template delegates all implementation decisions to autonomous intelligence capabilities
- **Creative Solution Enablement**: Template framework preserves intelligent adaptation while maintaining structural guidance
- **Analysis-First Intelligence**: Template requires examining actual conditions through intelligence rather than predetermined assumptions or declarations

## Framework Compliance

**Systematic Excellence Architecture:**
Reference: `@config:TB001`, `@config:AM001`, `@config:PE001`, `@config:RP001`, `@config:AR001`, `@config:OB001`

**6-Dimensional Execution Protocol:**
1. **Tool Parallelization**: Execute simultaneous tool operations with dependency challenge protocols
2. **Agent Assignment**: Route [task-type] through mandatory specialist assignment protocol with zero direct execution
3. **Parallel Planning**: Apply parallel-first decomposition patterns for [task-components] using coordination strategies
4. **Research Gates**: Complete comprehensive discovery requirements through systematic analysis before implementation
5. **Recursion Prevention**: Maintain flat agent hierarchy with single-level delegation exclusively
6. **Operation Batching**: Coordinate strategic operation grouping for enhanced performance and resource optimization

## Specialist Orchestration

**Systematic Specialist Creation:**
Intelligent specialist creation with framework compliance integration and coordination optimization:
