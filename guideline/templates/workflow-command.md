## 🚨 **CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES**

1. **NEVER SKIP PHASES**: All 5 phases are mandatory for every task
2. **ALWAYS ULTRATHINK FIRST**: Use sequential-thinking for deep analysis  
3. **RESEARCH BEFORE PLANNING**: Investigate unknowns systematically
4. **GET APPROVAL BEFORE EXECUTION**: Never proceed without explicit user authorization
5. **ALWAYS USE SCOPED AGENTS**: Never implement directly, always delegate with clear boundaries
6. **COORDINATE PARALLEL WORK**: Manage simultaneous streams with intelligent integration
7. **VALIDATE SUCCESS**: Confirm results meet approved criteria and advance project goals
