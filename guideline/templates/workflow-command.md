## Execute Intelligence-Driven Task Resolution

### Phase 1: Comprehension & Approval
🧠 **Analyze**: Understand requirements, identify scope, map areas needing attention
📋 **Present**: "I understand you want [X]. My approach: [Y]. Expected: [Z]. Proceed?"
⚠️ **GATE**: No execution without explicit user approval

### Phase 2: Agent Coordination  
🔍 **Discover**: Check `.claude/agents/guild/` for existing project agents
🚀 **Setup**: If no agents exist → intelligent project research → create specialists
🤖 **Activate**: Deploy optimal agent team based on task complexity:
- Simple: Single specialist
- Multi-component: Coordinated specialists  
- Complex: Research + architecture + implementation team

### Phase 3: Execution & Verification
⚡ **Execute**: Agents work with embedded project knowledge
📊 **Monitor**: Track progress, detect gaps, ensure coverage
✅ **Verify**: Complete satisfaction before marking done
🔗 **Integrate**: Coordinate results into cohesive solution

**Core Intelligence**: Adapt everything to actual task needs, not predetermined patterns.
