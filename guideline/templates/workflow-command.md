## Command Entry Point

<deep_reasoning_research>
**MANDATORY FIRST PHASE**: Deep reasoning and comprehensive research before any delegation

### Research Protocol
Execute all research streams in parallel via Task tool (ALL with thinking_mode: ultrathink):
- **Project Analysis**: Understand codebase structure, technologies, patterns via [serena_analysis] → Task tool with ultrathink
- **Documentation Research**: Leverage [context7_docs] and [web_resources] for framework guidance → Task tool with ultrathink
- **MCP Capability Assessment**: Evaluate [available_mcp_tools] for optimal task-tool matching → Task tool with ultrathink
- **Web Resource Discovery**: Use [web_search] for latest best practices and solutions → Task tool with ultrathink
- **Requirement Decomposition**: Break down [user_request] into actionable components → Task tool with ultrathink

**CRITICAL**: EVERY Task tool call in this phase MUST include thinking_mode: ultrathink parameter
**INSEPARABLE**: Ultrathink MUST ALWAYS be paired with parallel execution directives
**MANDATORY PAIRING**: Every "thinking_mode: ultrathink" MUST include "Parallelize ALL independent tool calls"

### Deep Reasoning Framework
<reasoning_structure>
1. **Context Understanding**: What is the user actually asking for?
2. **Project Context**: What type of project, technologies, and constraints exist?
3. **Resource Mapping**: What tools and resources are available for this task?
4. **Approach Synthesis**: How should this work be structured for optimal results?
5. **Success Criteria**: What would constitute complete and successful completion?
</reasoning_structure>

**OUTPUT**: Comprehensive understanding that informs all subsequent specialist delegation
</deep_reasoning_research>

**Building on Deep Reasoning & Research Phase**:
- Apply comprehensive understanding from [research_synthesis] to user request interpretation
- Identify work type: [coding|analysis|testing|deployment|documentation] based on [project_discovery]
- Determine complexity level: [simple|moderate|complex|multi-domain] informed by [resource_assessment]
- Map requirements to specialist capabilities using [mcp_tool_evaluation] and [documentation_research]
- Leverage [web_intelligence] for modern best practices and optimal approaches
</analysis>

<discovery>
### 2. Evidence-Based Analysis (Leveraging Research Results)
**Building on Deep Reasoning & Research Phase**:
- **Apply research findings** - Use [project_discovery] and [documentation_research] for informed analysis
- **Leverage discovered patterns** - Apply [technology_patterns] and [framework_conventions] from research phase
- **Context-enriched decisions** - Embed [research_synthesis] in all specialist prompts and instructions
- **Resource-informed strategy** - Use [mcp_capability_assessment] and [web_intelligence] for optimal approach
- **Evidence-driven delegation** - Base all specialist selection on [comprehensive_understanding] from research
</discovery>

<delegation>
### 3. Specialist Coordination
<specialist_selection>
- Check existing agents in guild inventory
- Match expertise to discovered work patterns
- Create dynamic specialist agent if no existing match (MANDATORY)
- Deploy multiple specialists for complex multi-domain tasks
- NEVER fall back to general-purpose execution - always use subagents
</specialist_selection>

<dynamic_agent_creation>
**MANDATORY DYNAMIC AGENT PROTOCOL**:
When no existing agent matches task requirements:
1. **Apply research intelligence** - Use [comprehensive_understanding] from Deep Reasoning & Research Phase to determine required expertise
2. **Create research-informed specialist** - Generate agent with precise capabilities based on [project_discovery] and [resource_assessment]
3. **Embed research context** - Include [discovered_technologies], [framework_patterns], and [best_practices] from research phase
4. **Apply ultrathink configuration** - All dynamic agents use thinking_mode: ultrathink for continued deep reasoning
5. **Coordinate research-driven execution** - Dynamic agents leverage [research_findings] and must batch tool calls for parallel work

**NEVER** fall back to general-purpose agents or direct execution - ALWAYS create dynamic specialists
**NEVER** persist examples, reports, or working state - ALL outputs are display-only
</dynamic_agent_creation>

<task_tool_usage>

- Validate ultrathink configuration before executing any delegation

**PARALLEL EXECUTION ENFORCEMENT**:
- EVERY Task tool call MUST include explicit parallel execution directives
- ALL subagent prompts MUST include "MANDATORY: Parallelize ALL independent tool calls - NEVER execute sequentially"

</task_tool_usage>
</delegation>

<coordination>
### 4. Progress Management

</coordination>

## Verification Framework

<verification_streams>
Execute all verification streams in parallel:

2. **Integration**: Components communicate and integrate properly
3. **Quality**: Code patterns followed, maintainable implementation
4. **Implementation Gap Detection**: MANDATORY comprehensive completeness review
5. **User**: Explicit approval obtained (final authority)
</verification_streams>

<implementation_gap_verification>
**MANDATORY POST-IMPLEMENTATION PROTOCOL**:

### Gap Detection Phase (Execute in Parallel via Task Tool)
<gap_detection_streams>
DELEGATE all detection streams to specialists via Task tool:
- **Requirements Audit**: Compare delivered work against ALL original user requirements
- **Integration Completeness**: Verify all components integrate and communicate properly
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Identify missing error handling, validation, and edge scenarios
- **Dependency Validation**: Ensure all required dependencies are properly implemented
- **Performance Verification**: Confirm implementation meets performance and efficiency expectations
- **Documentation Completeness**: Verify all changes are properly documented
</gap_detection_streams>

### Gap Resolution Phase (Execute via Task Tool)
<gap_resolution_protocol>
When gaps are detected:
1. **Systematic Cataloging**: Create comprehensive list of all identified gaps
2. **Priority Assessment**: Determine resolution order based on criticality and dependencies
3. **Specialist Delegation**: Route each gap resolution to appropriate specialist via Task tool
4. **Parallel Implementation**: Execute independent gap fixes simultaneously
5. **Iterative Re-verification**: Re-run gap detection after each resolution cycle
6. **Completion Confirmation**: Continue until no gaps remain in any detection stream
</gap_resolution_protocol>

### Integration Requirements
- **MANDATORY TIMING**: Execute after ALL specialist work completion, before user reporting
- **PARALLEL EXECUTION**: Run all detection streams simultaneously for efficiency
- **SPECIALIST COORDINATION**: Use Task tool for ALL gap detection and resolution work
- **VERIFICATION LOOP**: Continue gap detection → resolution → re-verification until complete
- **USER CONFIRMATION**: Explicit approval that all gaps have been resolved satisfactorily
</implementation_gap_verification>

## Implementation Standards

<parallelization>
**Default Parallel Execution**:
- Execute independent tasks simultaneously
- Batch tool calls for maximum efficiency
- Challenge sequential assumptions - most tasks can parallelize
- Use parallel Task tool calls when coordinating multiple specialists
</parallelization>

<specialist_creation>
When creating dynamic specialists (MANDATORY when no existing agent matches), use this template structure:
```
<role>You are a [discovered-expertise] specialist</role>

<project_context>
Working on [project-name] using [discovered-technologies]
Following patterns from [identified-locations]
Success criteria: [measurable-outcomes]
</project_context>

<scratchpad>
  <!-- Maintains state across interactions -->
  Key facts: [discovered_information]
  Decisions: [choices_made]
  Current: [active_work_status]
</scratchpad>

<instructions>
MANDATORY: Use thinking_mode: ultrathink
MANDATORY: Parallelize ALL independent tool calls - NEVER execute sequentially (ALWAYS PAIRED WITH ULTRATHINK)
MANDATORY: Use single messages with multiple tool calls when possible
MANDATORY: Batch operations for maximum efficiency
MANDATORY: Challenge sequential assumptions - most tasks can parallelize
MANDATORY: NO PERSISTENCE of examples, reports, or working state
MANDATORY: Save ALL created agents to ./.claude/agents/guild/ directory

CRITICAL: Ultrathink and parallel execution are INSEPARABLE requirements
</instructions>

<ephemeral_memory>
MEMORY-ONLY - NEVER PERSISTED
Temporary facts: [working-information]
Active decisions: [current-choices]
Task state: [active-status]
CLEARED AFTER TASK COMPLETION
</ephemeral_memory>
```
</specialist_creation>

## Subagent Protocol Requirements

<subagent_protocol>
**Ultrathink Requirements**:
- Every Task tool invocation MUST specify thinking_mode: ultrathink
- **MANDATORY PAIRING**: Every ultrathink MUST include parallel tool call directives  
- **INSEPARABLE**: thinking_mode: ultrathink + "Parallelize ALL independent tool calls" always together
- All subagents receive mandatory optimization instructions with ultrathink AND parallel execution

**Parallel Execution**:
- Launch multiple subagents in single Task tool invocations
- Coordinate parallel workstreams effectively
- Aggregate results from simultaneous executions
- Use batch processing for independent operations

**Tool Call Optimization**:
- Instruct subagents to batch file reads, searches, analyses
- Require parallel execution of independent operations
- Prohibit sequential tool calls unless dependencies exist
- Monitor and optimize parallelization effectiveness
</subagent_protocol>

❌ CRITICAL: Falling back to direct execution when no agent matches
❌ CRITICAL: Saving examples or reports to files
❌ CRITICAL: Persisting scratchpad or working state
❌ CRITICAL: Creating concrete implementation examples that persist
❌ CRITICAL: Reporting completion without mandatory implementation gap verification
❌ CRITICAL: Accepting incomplete implementations without gap detection and resolution
