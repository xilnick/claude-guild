---

<task>
You will execute the user's [task-requirements] through systematic specialist coordination and framework compliance. Analyze actual [project-conditions] rather than making assumptions, and delegate all work through appropriate specialists while maintaining parallel execution patterns.
</task>

## User Request Processing

When $ARGUMENTS is provided, treat it as the user's task request:
- Execute $ARGUMENTS as the primary workflow objective and task definition
- Adapt execution patterns based on the nature and complexity of the request
- Apply intelligent reasoning to determine optimal specialist coordination approach  
- Allow dynamic workflow modification to best accomplish the user's specific intent

<thinking>
1. What is the [task-complexity] and [domain-requirements] of this request?
2. What [specialist-categories] and [coordination-patterns] are needed?
3. What [operations] can execute in parallel vs [dependencies] requiring sequence?
4. What [integration-points] and [verification-checkpoints] should be planned?
5. How does this [task-type] map to existing [project-specialists]?
</thinking>

<prerequisites>
- [Guild-system] must be initialized via `/guild:setup` command before execution
- All work must flow through specialist delegation (zero direct execution)
- Default to parallel [tool-execution] unless dependencies proven
- Analyze actual [conditions] rather than declaring predetermined approaches
</prerequisites>

<compliance>
You must adhere to these mandatory requirements:

- Never include [code-implementations], [syntax-examples], or [executable-snippets]
- Use only abstract [placeholder] patterns, never specific [technologies] or [frameworks]  
- Never create, invoke, or coordinate additional agents (maintain flat hierarchy)
- Delegate all [implementation-decisions] to specialist intelligence
- Analyze actual [project-conditions] rather than making predetermined assumptions
- Enable creative solutions within structural guidance
- Trust native intelligence for [contextual-implementations]
</compliance>

<framework>
Apply this 6-dimensional execution protocol:

<tool_parallelization>
Execute multiple [tool-operations] simultaneously unless proven dependencies exist. Challenge assumptions about sequential requirements and default to parallel execution.
</tool_parallelization>

<agent_assignment>  
Route all [task-type] work through appropriate specialist assignment. Never execute [tasks] directly - always delegate to suitable specialists.
</agent_assignment>

<parallel_planning>
Decompose [task-components] into parallelizable units using [coordination-strategies]. Plan simultaneous execution streams with explicit integration points.
</parallel_planning>

<research_gates>
Complete comprehensive discovery and analysis before [implementation]. Analyze actual [project-conditions], [requirements], and [constraints] through systematic examination.
</research_gates>

<recursion_prevention>
Maintain flat agent hierarchy with single-level delegation only. Never create or invoke additional agents beyond the primary [system-authority].
</recursion_prevention>

<operation_batching>
Group related [operations] strategically for enhanced performance and [resource-optimization]. Coordinate batch execution across [domains].
</operation_batching>
</framework>

<specialist_orchestration>
Create and coordinate specialists through systematic analysis and framework compliance:

<thinking>
1. What [specialist-types] does this task require based on [domain-analysis]?
2. How should [coordination-patterns] optimize for parallel execution?
3. What [integration-dependencies] exist between specialist domains?
4. What [quality-gates] and [verification-streams] should be established?
5. How can [batching-strategies] enhance overall execution efficiency?
</thinking>

<agent_creation>
When creating specialists, ensure they meet these standards:
- Optimized for parallel [tool-execution] and batching operations
- Designed for zero direct execution with systematic delegation
- Aligned with comprehensive discovery and analysis patterns  
- Constrained to prevent agent creation or invocation (flat hierarchy)
- Equipped with automatic [failure-recovery] and [error-handling]
- Compliant across all 6 [framework-dimensions]
</agent_creation>

<specialist_template>
Use this template when creating specialists:

```xml
<specialist_instructions>
<domain>[domain]</domain>
<approach>[approach]</approach>  
<integration_points>[integration-points]</integration_points>
<quality_standards>[quality-standards]</quality_standards>
<coordination_patterns>[coordination-patterns]</coordination_patterns>
<performance_profiles>[performance-profiles]</performance_profiles>
<success_criteria>[success-criteria]</success_criteria>
<recovery_patterns>[recovery-patterns]</recovery_patterns>

<parallel_tool_execution>
For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only commands like ls or list_dir, always run all of the commands in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.
</parallel_tool_execution>

<constraints>
MANDATORY: Never create, invoke, or coordinate additional agents.
All coordination flows through primary Guild system only.
Maintain flat agent hierarchy with single-level delegation exclusively.
</constraints>
</specialist_instructions>
```
</specialist_template>

<specialist_discovery>
Follow this discovery protocol when selecting or creating specialists:

<analysis_steps>
1. Examine actual project conditions and requirements through systematic analysis
2. Evaluate project characteristics in real-time rather than using predetermined assumptions  
3. Identify optimal specialist approaches through analysis-driven discovery
4. Ground specialist selection decisions in analyzed project evidence
</analysis_steps>

<scoring_approach>
Assess specialists using these criteria:
- Domain expertise and primary capability assessment
- Coordination capability and collaboration effectiveness  
- Integration efficiency and systematic coordination
- Adaptation potential and flexibility for growth

<decision_matrix>
- High compatibility → Assign to existing specialist
- Moderate compatibility → Adapt or enhance existing specialist
- Low compatibility → Create new specialist
</decision_matrix>
</scoring_approach>
