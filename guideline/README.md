- **Global compatibility** - Works identically across all environments via `npx claude-guild@latest`
- **Template independence** - No runtime dependency on external files

### Advanced Workflow Orchestration  
- **Multi-stage execution** with intelligent task routing and parallel agent coordination
- **Context engineering** with XML-structured packages and long-context optimization
- **Thinking mode integration** for appropriate cognitive resource allocation
- **Technology-agnostic design** with universal workflow patterns

### Agent System Excellence
- **Context-only agents** (analysis, research, planning) that never make changes
- **Implementation agents** (verification, technology engineers) that execute changes
- **Structured communication** with XML handoff protocols and quality gates
- **Technology detection** with automatic specialized agent creation

## Core Commands

### Base Command
```bash
/guild [flags] "task"
```

### Essential Flags
- **--full**: Complete development lifecycle (analysis → research → planning → implementation → testing → verification → refactoring)
- **--fix**: Systematic bug fixing with debugging workflow
- **--plan**: Planning-only mode with optional save to file
- **--research**: Research-only mode for context gathering
- **--spec**: Documentation-first development with specification management
- **--project**: Project-wide scope for comprehensive changes

### Specialized Setup
```bash
# Standard Guild system
/guild:setup

```

### Automatic Technology Detection
Guild analyzes your project and creates specialized agents for detected technologies:
- **React/Vue/Angular**: Frontend engineering specialists
- **Express/FastAPI/Rails**: Backend API specialists  
- **CLI tools**: Command-line interface specialists
- **NPM packages**: Package development specialists
- **Database patterns**: Data layer specialists

## Workflow Patterns

### Standard Development Flow
```yaml
Analysis → Research → Planning → Implementation → Validation
```

### Comprehensive Development (--full)
```yaml
Analysis → Research → Planning → Implementation → Testing → Verification → Refactoring
```

### Specialized Workflows
- **Bug Fixing**: `--fix` for systematic debugging
- **Planning Only**: `--plan` for strategic analysis without implementation
- **Research Mode**: `--research` for context gathering and investigation
- **Spec-Driven**: `--spec` for documentation-first development

## Agent Classification System

### Context-Only Agents (Never Make Changes)
- **guild-reasoning-agent**: Task analysis and requirement clarification
- **guild-planning-agent**: Strategic workflow coordination (ultrathink mode)
- **guild-research-agents**: Context gathering and information synthesis

### Implementation Agents (Make Changes)
- **guild-verification-agent**: Quality validation and testing execution
- **Technology engineers**: Domain-specific implementation specialists

**Communication Protocol**: All agents use structured XML handoff templates for seamless context transfer and quality assurance.

## Standalone Agent System

### Self-Contained Specialists
Independent agents operating without .guild system infrastructure:

**Security & Compliance**:
- **security-analyst-agent**: Vulnerability assessment, OWASP compliance
- **accessibility-auditor-agent**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, ARIA implementation

**Performance & Quality**:
- **performance-engineer-agent**: Database optimization, caching strategies
- **code-reviewer-agent**: Code quality analysis, refactoring recommendations

**Documentation & Architecture**: 
- **documentation-writer-agent**: Technical docs, API documentation
- **api-architect-agent**: API design patterns, integration strategies

**Operations & Testing**:
- **deployment-engineer-agent**: CI/CD optimization, infrastructure as code
- **testing-strategist-agent**: Test strategy development, automation

### Automatic Activation
Standalone agents activate automatically based on task keywords:
```bash
"Review security vulnerabilities" → security-analyst-agent
"Optimize database performance" → performance-engineer-agent  
"Ensure accessibility compliance" → accessibility-auditor-agent
```

## Configuration System

### Priority Hierarchy
```yaml
1. User Prompts: Direct requests override all system behavior
2. Instructions.md: Optional user customization (thin configuration)  
3. Default Prompts: System defaults (lowest priority)
```

### Thinking Mode Configuration
```yaml
Required Prefilled Configuration:
  guild-planning-agent:
    thinking_mode: ultrathink
    model: opus
    
All Other Agents:
  thinking_mode: think (default)
  model: inherited from Claude Code
```
