# Claude Guild Architecture

## Design Philosophy

Claude Guild follows these core architectural principles:

### 1. Simplicity Over Complexity
- **Thin agents**: Metadata-only definitions (<20 lines) with integrated thinking modes
- **Centralized processes**: All logic in one place with context optimization
- **Clear separation**: Each layer has single responsibility with structured handoffs
- **Minimal configuration**: Sensible defaults, override when needed

### 2. Technology Agnostic
- **Pattern detection**: Recognize patterns, not specific frameworks
- **Universal workflows**: Work with any technology stack
- **Future-proof**: Adapts to new technologies automatically
- **No hardcoding**: No framework-specific implementations

### 3. Performance First
- **Parallel by default**: Concurrent execution when possible
- **Context optimization**: Smart filtering and compression with XML structuring
- **Streaming pipelines**: Continuous flow with progressive context building
- **Adaptive strategies**: Dynamic adjustment based on conditions and thinking modes

### 4. Context Engineering Excellence
- **Long-context optimization**: Reference-based linking and hierarchical summarization
- **Structured handoffs**: XML-tagged context transfer between agents
- **Progressive detail**: Start with summaries, expand as needed
- **Intelligent compression**: Automatic relevance filtering and context pruning

### 5. Cognitive Resource Allocation
- **Thinking mode integration**: Strategic use of enhanced reasoning capabilities
- **Chain-of-thought reasoning**: Structured problem decomposition
- **Appropriate cognitive load**: Match thinking complexity to task requirements

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Purpose | Implementation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Commands** | User interface and orchestration | Markdown files with embedded logic |
| **Processes** | Reusable workflow logic | Process definitions in templates |
| **Agents** | Role specifications | Thin metadata files |
| **Configuration** | User customization | Instructions.md files |

## Dynamic Generation System

### Intelligence-Driven Installation Flow

```yaml
1. NPM Package Installation:
   - User runs: npx claude-guild@latest
   - System analyzes project structure and patterns
   
2. Project Intelligence Gathering:
   - Detect technology stack and architecture patterns
   - Assess project complexity and requirements
   - Identify optimal agent specializations and workflow needs
   
3. Intelligent System Generation:
   - Generate agents with embedded project intelligence
   - Create self-contained commands with embedded logic
   - Configure context engineering for detected patterns
   - No external dependencies after generation
```

### Why Pure Dynamic Generation?

1. **True Intelligence**: Agents understand specific project context and patterns
2. **Future-Proof**: Adapts to any technology evolution without system updates
3. **Self-Contained**: Generated systems work independently with embedded intelligence
4. **Project-Adaptive**: Optimized for actual project patterns, architecture, and needs

## Agent Architecture

### Thin Agent Design

**Design Philosophy**: Agents are metadata-only (<20 lines) that reference centralized processes with integrated thinking modes

```yaml
# Agent Definition (Enhanced with Context Engineering)
---
name: unique-identifier
role: primary-function
processes: [process-references]
scope: operational-boundary
parallel: true/false
thinking_mode: think|think-harder|ultrathink
context_optimization: enabled
---

## Role Description
{Clear, specific role definition following "new employee with amnesia" principle}

## Enhanced Thinking Mode  
**{thinking_mode}** - {Specific reasoning requirements and chain-of-thought guidance}

## Context Management
- Input: {Expected context structure and requirements}
- Output: {Generated context format and handoff protocols}
- Optimization: {Context compression and transfer strategies}
```

### Dynamic Agent Generation Lifecycle

    B --> C[Intelligence Synthesis]
    C --> D[Context-Aware Agent Generation]
    D --> E[Logic Embedding]
    E --> F[Self-Contained System Ready]
```

### Agent Types

| Type | Purpose | Process References |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Reasoning** | Task analysis | analyze-task, assess-complexity |
| **Planning** | Workflow coordination | create-plan, route-agents |
| **Research** | Context gathering | research-context, aggregate-findings |
| **Implementation** | Task execution | implement-solution, validate-changes |
| **Verification** | Quality assurance | run-tests, verify-requirements |

## Process Architecture

### Process Definition

```yaml
process: process-name
  description: what it does
  inputs: [required-data]
  steps:
    - step 1 action
    - step 2 action
  outputs: [produced-results]
  parallel: true/false
  error_handling: strategy
```

### Execution Models

#### Sequential Execution
```
Process A → Process B → Process C
```
- Clear dependencies
- Predictable flow
- Simple error handling

#### Parallel Execution
```
Process A ⟍
Process B → Aggregation
Process C ⟋
```
- Independent contexts
- Result merging
- Maximum efficiency

#### Pipeline Execution
```
Process A → Process B (starts early)
         ↘ Process C (overlapped)
```
- Continuous flow
- Early starts
- Reduced latency

## Routing System

### Task Classification

```yaml
Task Analysis:
  Input: user task description
  
  Detection:
    - Technology patterns
    - Complexity assessment
    - Scope determination
    
  Classification:
    Simple: Single agent, linear flow
    Medium: Multiple agents, coordination
    Complex: Many agents, parallel execution
    
  Output: routing decision
```

### Routing Decision Tree

```
Task → [Classify] → Simple? → Single Agent
                 ↓
              Medium? → Coordinated Team
                 ↓
              Complex? → Parallel Groups
```

### Dynamic Routing

Routing adapts based on:
- **Task complexity**: More agents for complex tasks
- **Available resources**: Adjust parallelization
- **Historical performance**: Learn from patterns
- **Context size**: Optimize transfer strategies

## Parallel Execution

### Coordination Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Independent Scopes
```yaml
When: Clear boundaries exist
How: Assign exclusive domains
Example:
  Frontend Team || Backend Team || Database Team
```

#### Strategy 2: Pipeline Parallel
```yaml
When: Stages can overlap
How: Start next stage early
Example:
  Research → Planning (early start) → Implementation
```

#### Strategy 3: Adaptive Parallel
```yaml
When: Dynamic adjustment needed
How: Monitor and adapt
Factors:
  - Task complexity
  - System load
  - Context size
  - Success patterns
```

### Synchronization Mechanisms

```yaml
Context Isolation:
  - Separate working contexts
  - File access boundaries
  - Independent state

Synchronization Points:
  - Milestone checkpoints
  - Result aggregation
  - Phase transitions

Conflict Resolution:
  - Lock mechanisms
  - Sequential fallback
  - Merge strategies
```

## Context Management

### Context Lifecycle

```
Generation → Filtering → Transfer → Usage → Decay → Removal
```

### Optimization Techniques

|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Relevance Scoring** | Keep only needed data | Score and filter by importance |
| **Compression** | Reduce size | Summarize verbose information |
| **Caching** | Reuse common data | Multi-level cache hierarchy |
| **Decay** | Remove stale data | Age-based removal |

### Transfer Protocol
