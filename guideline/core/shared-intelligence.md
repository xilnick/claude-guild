### Universal Parallel Tool Execution System Prompts

EMBED [mandatory-anthropic-parallel-prompts] in all [generated-agent-specifications] through [system-prompt-integration]:

#### Official Anthropic Parallel Tool System Prompts
**MANDATORY BASIC PROMPT** (for all Claude 4 agents):
```
For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
```

**MANDATORY DETAILED PROMPT** (for enhanced parallel execution):
```xml
<use_parallel_tool_calls>
For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only commands like `ls` or `list_dir`, always run all of the commands in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.
</use_parallel_tool_calls>
```

**GUILD SYSTEM INTEGRATION PROMPT**:
```xml
<system_prompt>
You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response.
When multiple independent pieces of information are requested,
batch your tool calls together for optimal performance.

<use_parallel_tool_calls>
For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.
</use_parallel_tool_calls>
</system_prompt>
