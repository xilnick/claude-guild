# Parallel Execution Module
**Version**: 2.3.0 | **Last Updated**: 2025-01-16 | **Dependencies**: principles.md, agents.md, workflows.md

## Purpose
Essential parallel execution strategies for efficient Guild system performance. This module is embedded into the setup command.

## Claude Execution Instructions

**CRITICAL**: These are direct execution patterns for Claude to follow when implementing parallel task execution.

### Parallel Task Detection Protocol

**When to Parallelize**:
```yaml
Detection Pattern:
  IF (task involves multiple similar operations):
    AND (operations are independent):
    AND (same specialist type required):
    THEN enable parallel execution

Examples:
  - "Update error handling in all service files" → Multiple files, same pattern
  - "Add tests to all components" → Multiple files, same specialist
  - "Refactor 15 UI components for new design" → Independent components, same changes
  - "Implement CRUD endpoints for 5 entities" → Similar patterns, independent entities
```

### Instance Spawning Execution Pattern

**Claude Task Tool Usage**:
```yaml
Step 1: Analyze Task Independence
  - Count total similar tasks
  - Verify no cross-dependencies  
  - Identify specialist type needed

Step 2: Calculate Instance Count
  optimal_instances = min(ceil(task_count / 3), 3)
  
  Examples:
  - 2-3 tasks → 1 instance (not worth parallelizing)
  - 4-6 tasks → 2 instances 
  - 7+ tasks → 3 instances (maximum)

Step 3: Distribute Tasks Using Task Tool
  FOR each instance (1 to optimal_instances):
    Task [specialist-agent] (Instance {i}): 
    "Handle your assigned batch: [specific task assignments]
    
    Context Package:
    - Overall Task: [original user request]
    - Your Batch: [files/components assigned to this instance]
    - Project Patterns: [relevant patterns and conventions]
    - Integration Requirements: [how your work fits with others]
    
    Specific Instructions:
    - Work only on assigned files: [list]
    - Follow project patterns discovered in context
    - Coordinate with parallel instances for integration
    - Report progress and completion status
    
    Expected Output: [specific deliverables for this batch]"

Step 4: Aggregate Results
  - Wait for all instances to complete
  - Collect and merge all outputs
  - Validate integration between instances
  - Report combined results to user
```

### Task Distribution Algorithms

**Complexity-Based Distribution**:
```yaml
When task complexity varies significantly:

Estimation Factors:
  - File size (lines of code)
  - Dependencies count
  - Pattern complexity (simple update vs major refactor)
  - Historical timing data (if available)

Distribution Strategy:
  1. Estimate work for each task (low/medium/high)
  2. Sort tasks by complexity (high first)
  3. Assign to least-loaded instance
  
Example: 9 tasks, 3 instances
  High complexity: [task1(8min), task2(7min), task3(6min)]
  Medium: [task4(4min), task5(4min), task6(3min)]  
  Low: [task7(2min), task8(2min), task9(1min)]
  
  Distribution:
  Instance 1: [task1(8min), task9(1min)] = 9min
  Instance 2: [task2(7min), task8(2min)] = 9min  
  Instance 3: [task3(6min), task4(4min)] = 10min
```

**Affinity-Based Distribution**:
```yaml
When tasks have natural groupings:

Domain Affinity (preferred):
  - User-related files → Instance 1
  - Product-related files → Instance 2  
  - Order-related files → Instance 3

Technical Affinity:
  - React components (.tsx) → Instance 1
  - Services (.service.ts) → Instance 2
  - Tests (.test.ts) → Instance 3

Dependency Affinity:
  - Files importing UserTypes → Instance 1
  - Files importing ProductTypes → Instance 2
  - Independent utilities → Instance 3

Benefits: Context reuse, pattern consistency, fewer conflicts
```

**Round-Robin Fallback**:
```yaml
When no clear complexity or affinity patterns:

Simple Distribution:
  Instance 1: Tasks [1, 4, 7, 10, ...]
  Instance 2: Tasks [2, 5, 8, 11, ...]
  Instance 3: Tasks [3, 6, 9, 12, ...]
  
Ensures: Even distribution, minimal coordination overhead
```

### Coordination Execution Patterns

**File Ownership Strategy**:
```yaml
Assignment Pattern:
  - Each file assigned to exactly one instance
  - No shared write access during execution
  - Read-only access to shared context/patterns
  - Clear boundaries prevent conflicts

Implementation:
  Instance 1 owns: [file1.ts, file4.ts, file7.ts]
  Instance 2 owns: [file2.ts, file5.ts, file8.ts]
  Instance 3 owns: [file3.ts, file6.ts, file9.ts]
  
Validation: Check no file appears in multiple instance assignments
```

**Progress Reporting Pattern**:
```yaml
Each Instance Reports:
  - "Starting work on assigned batch: [file_list]"
  - "Completed [N/total] files in batch"
  - "Finished all assigned work: [summary_of_changes]"
  
Aggregation:
  - Monitor all instance progress
  - Collect completion reports
  - Validate no missing work
  - Synthesize final results
```

### Error Handling Execution

**Instance Failure Recovery**:
```yaml
IF instance fails or produces errors:
  1. Log the specific failure with details
  2. Extract unfinished tasks from failed instance
  3. Redistribute failed tasks to other instances OR
  4. Handle failed tasks in main thread
  5. Continue with successful instance results
  6. Report partial success with issue details

Example Recovery:
  "Instance 2 failed on complex refactoring task.
   Redistributing remaining files [X, Y, Z] to Instance 1.
   Completed 80% of requested changes successfully."
```

### Performance Optimization Patterns

**Dynamic Load Balancing**:
```yaml
IF instance finishes early:
  1. Check if other instances still have pending work
  2. Identify tasks that can be safely redistributed
  3. Use Task tool to assign additional work:
     Task [specialist-agent] (Instance {fast_instance}):
     "Take on additional tasks from overloaded instances: [new_tasks]"
  4. Update progress tracking

Work Stealing Example:
  Instance 1: Finished early (completed 3 tasks in 5 min)
  Instance 2: Still working (2/5 tasks completed, struggling)
  Action: Reassign 1-2 tasks from Instance 2 to Instance 1
```

### Concrete Execution Examples

**Example 1: API Endpoint Updates**
```yaml
User Request: "Add authentication middleware to all 12 API endpoints"

Detection: 12 independent files, same pattern, backend specialist needed
Instance Count: 3 (12 tasks / 3 = 4 each)

Execution:
Task guild-backend-engineer (Instance 1):
"Add authentication middleware to your assigned endpoints:
- /api/users/*, /api/users/profile, /api/users/settings, /api/users/preferences
Follow existing middleware patterns in project.
Output: Updated endpoint files with auth middleware"

Task guild-backend-engineer (Instance 2):  
"Add authentication middleware to your assigned endpoints:
- /api/products/*, /api/products/search, /api/products/categories, /api/products/reviews
Follow existing middleware patterns in project.
Output: Updated endpoint files with auth middleware"

Task guild-backend-engineer (Instance 3):
"Add authentication middleware to your assigned endpoints:  
- /api/orders/*, /api/orders/history, /api/orders/tracking, /api/orders/refunds
Follow existing middleware patterns in project.
Output: Updated endpoint files with auth middleware"

Expected Result: 3x speedup (4 min instead of 12 min)
```

**Example 2: Component Refactoring**
```yaml
User Request: "Convert 15 class components to functional components with hooks"

Detection: 15 independent components, same pattern, frontend specialist needed
Instance Count: 3 (15 tasks / 3 = 5 each)

Affinity Distribution:
Instance 1: User-related components [UserProfile, UserList, UserCard, UserSettings, UserModal]
Instance 2: Product components [ProductList, ProductCard, ProductDetail, ProductSearch, ProductFilter]  
Instance 3: Order components [OrderList, OrderCard, OrderDetail, OrderHistory, OrderTracking]

Execution:
Task guild-frontend-engineer (Instance 1):
"Convert your assigned user components to functional with hooks:
[UserProfile.tsx, UserList.tsx, UserCard.tsx, UserSettings.tsx, UserModal.tsx]
Use project's existing hook patterns and follow component conventions.
Maintain all existing functionality and props interfaces.
Output: Converted functional components with hooks"

[Similar patterns for instances 2 and 3]

Expected Result: 3x speedup with domain expertise benefits
```

## Embedded Intelligence


### Core Parallelization Philosophy

**Simple Parallel Strategy**: Work in parallel when tasks are independent, coordinate only at integration boundaries.

**Default Settings**:
```yaml
Concurrency Limits:
  per_agent_type: 3 instances (configurable)
  total_parallel: 20 agents maximum (configurable)
  load_balancing: automatic task distribution
  resource_management: dynamic scaling based on workload

Parallelization Triggers:
  independent_tasks: Always parallelize when no dependencies exist
  different_files: Parallel work on separate files within same scope
  different_components: Parallel work on independent components
  different_scopes: Complete independence across project areas
```

### Same-Agent Multiple Instance Parallelization

**Core Concept**: Spawn multiple instances of the SAME specialist agent to process independent tasks in parallel.

**Enhanced Automatic Instance Spawning**:
```yaml
Advanced Detection Patterns:
  file_affinity_patterns:
    - Multiple files needing same type of modification
    - Files sharing common dependencies or imports
    - Components within same domain/feature area
    - Files with similar complexity characteristics

  component_affinity_patterns:
    - Independent components requiring same specialist
    - Related UI components (List/Card/Detail patterns)
    - Service layer components with shared patterns
    - Data models with similar structure

  operation_affinity_patterns:
    - Batch operations on similar code patterns
    - Parallel test creation for related modules
    - Migration tasks across similar structures
    - Refactoring operations with shared goals

Predictive Spawning Strategy:
  1. Planning agent analyzes task complexity and affinity patterns
  2. Estimates optimal instance count using predictive algorithms:
     instance_count = min(max(tasks/optimal_load_per_agent, 1), 3)
     optimal_load_per_agent = base_capacity * complexity_adjustment
  3. Applies affinity-based grouping before distribution
  4. Spawns instances with specialized context packages
  5. Monitors performance and adjusts dynamically

Affinity-Based Task Grouping:
  domain_affinity:
    - Group tasks by business domain (user, product, order)
    - Assign domain-related tasks to same instance
    - Benefits: Domain expertise accumulation, consistent patterns

  technical_affinity:
    - Group by file type or technology (.tsx, .service.ts, .test.ts)
    - Assign similar technical patterns to same instance
    - Benefits: Technical specialization, optimized tooling usage

  dependency_affinity:
    - Group files sharing common imports or dependencies
    - Assign interdependent components to same instance
    - Benefits: Reduced context switching, better integration awareness

  complexity_affinity:
    - Group tasks by estimated complexity level
    - Assign similar complexity tasks to specialized instances
    - Benefits: Balanced workloads, specialized handling approaches
```

**Real-World Examples**:
```yaml
Example 1 - Interface Specialist (3 instances):
  Instance 1: Updates UserList.tsx, UserCard.tsx
  Instance 2: Updates ProductList.tsx, ProductCard.tsx
  Instance 3: Updates OrderList.tsx, OrderCard.tsx
  Result: 3x faster than sequential processing

Example 2 - Service Specialist (3 instances):
  Instance 1: Implements user.service.ts
  Instance 2: Implements product.service.ts
  Instance 3: Implements order.service.ts
  Result: Complete service layer in 1/3 time

Example 3 - Test Specialist (3 instances):
  Instance 1: Creates tests for components A-F
  Instance 2: Creates tests for components G-L
  Instance 3: Creates tests for components M-R
  Result: Full test coverage 3x faster
```

**Enhanced Task Distribution Algorithm**:
```yaml
Work Estimation-Based Distribution:
  complexity_factors:
    - File size and lines of code
    - Number of dependencies and imports
    - Pattern complexity (regex, loops, conditionals)
    - Historical completion times for similar tasks

  estimation_formula:
    base_time = file_size_factor * complexity_multiplier
    adjusted_time = base_time * (1 + dependency_factor)
    final_estimate = adjusted_time * historical_adjustment

Intelligent Distribution Logic:
  # Instead of simple round-robin, use work estimation
  tasks = [
    {file: "file1.ts", estimated_time: 5min, complexity: "medium"},
    {file: "file2.ts", estimated_time: 2min, complexity: "low"},
    {file: "file3.ts", estimated_time: 8min, complexity: "high"},
    {file: "file4.ts", estimated_time: 3min, complexity: "medium"},
    {file: "file5.ts", estimated_time: 4min, complexity: "medium"},
    {file: "file6.ts", estimated_time: 6min, complexity: "high"},
    {file: "file7.ts", estimated_time: 2min, complexity: "low"}
  ]

  # Optimal distribution for 3 agents (total: 30min → 10min each)
  Agent 1: [file3.ts(8min), file7.ts(2min)] = 10min
  Agent 2: [file6.ts(6min), file4.ts(3min)] = 9min
  Agent 3: [file1.ts(5min), file5.ts(4min), file2.ts(2min)] = 11min

Affinity-Based Assignment:
  principle: Assign similar tasks to same instance for context reuse
  patterns:
    - Same file type → same agent (*.tsx files to agent 1)
    - Similar complexity → same agent (complex files to specialized agent)
    - Related components → same agent (UserList, UserCard to same agent)
    - Shared dependencies → same agent (files importing same modules)

  benefits:
    - Reduced context switching overhead
    - Better pattern recognition and consistency
    - Improved code quality through specialization
    - Faster execution due to context reuse

Round-Robin Fallback:
  - When work estimation unavailable
  - Ensures even distribution
  - Minimizes idle time
  - Allows work stealing if one finishes early
```

### Parallelization Patterns

```

**Quality Parallelization**:
```yaml
