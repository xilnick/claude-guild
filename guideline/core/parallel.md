Essential parallel execution strategies for efficient Guild system performance. This module is embedded into the setup command.

## Embedded Intelligence

### Core Parallelization Philosophy

**Simple Parallel Strategy**: Work in parallel when tasks are independent, coordinate only at integration boundaries.

**Default Settings**:
```yaml
Concurrency Limits:
  per_agent_type: 3 instances (configurable)
  total_parallel: 20 agents maximum (configurable)
  load_balancing: automatic task distribution
  resource_management: dynamic scaling based on workload

Parallelization Triggers:
  independent_tasks: Always parallelize when no dependencies exist
  different_files: Parallel work on separate files within same scope
  different_components: Parallel work on independent components
  different_scopes: Complete independence across project areas
```

### Same-Agent Multiple Instance Parallelization

**Core Concept**: Spawn multiple instances of the SAME specialist agent to process independent tasks in parallel.

**Enhanced Automatic Instance Spawning**:
```yaml
Advanced Detection Patterns:
  file_affinity_patterns:
    - Multiple files needing same type of modification
    - Files sharing common dependencies or imports
    - Components within same domain/feature area
    - Files with similar complexity characteristics
  
  component_affinity_patterns:
    - Independent components requiring same specialist
    - Related UI components (List/Card/Detail patterns)
    - Service layer components with shared patterns
    - Data models with similar structure
    
  operation_affinity_patterns:
    - Batch operations on similar code patterns
    - Parallel test creation for related modules
    - Migration tasks across similar structures
    - Refactoring operations with shared goals

Predictive Spawning Strategy:
  1. Planning agent analyzes task complexity and affinity patterns
  2. Estimates optimal instance count using predictive algorithms:
     instance_count = min(max(tasks/optimal_load_per_agent, 1), 3)
     optimal_load_per_agent = base_capacity * complexity_adjustment
  3. Applies affinity-based grouping before distribution
  4. Spawns instances with specialized context packages
  5. Monitors performance and adjusts dynamically

Affinity-Based Task Grouping:
  domain_affinity:
    - Group tasks by business domain (user, product, order)
    - Assign domain-related tasks to same instance
    - Benefits: Domain expertise accumulation, consistent patterns
    
  technical_affinity:
    - Group by file type or technology (.tsx, .service.ts, .test.ts)
    - Assign similar technical patterns to same instance
    - Benefits: Technical specialization, optimized tooling usage
    
  dependency_affinity:
    - Group files sharing common imports or dependencies
    - Assign interdependent components to same instance
    - Benefits: Reduced context switching, better integration awareness
    
  complexity_affinity:
    - Group tasks by estimated complexity level
    - Assign similar complexity tasks to specialized instances
    - Benefits: Balanced workloads, specialized handling approaches
```

**Real-World Examples**:
```yaml
Example 1 - Interface Specialist (3 instances):
  Instance 1: Updates UserList.tsx, UserCard.tsx
  Instance 2: Updates ProductList.tsx, ProductCard.tsx  
  Instance 3: Updates OrderList.tsx, OrderCard.tsx
  Result: 3x faster than sequential processing

Example 2 - Service Specialist (3 instances):
  Instance 1: Implements user.service.ts
  Instance 2: Implements product.service.ts
  Instance 3: Implements order.service.ts
  Result: Complete service layer in 1/3 time

Example 3 - Test Specialist (3 instances):
  Instance 1: Creates tests for components A-F
  Instance 2: Creates tests for components G-L
  Instance 3: Creates tests for components M-R
  Result: Full test coverage 3x faster
```

**Enhanced Task Distribution Algorithm**:
```yaml
Work Estimation-Based Distribution:
  complexity_factors:
    - File size and lines of code
    - Number of dependencies and imports
    - Pattern complexity (regex, loops, conditionals)
    - Historical completion times for similar tasks
    
  estimation_formula:
    base_time = file_size_factor * complexity_multiplier
    adjusted_time = base_time * (1 + dependency_factor)
    final_estimate = adjusted_time * historical_adjustment

Intelligent Distribution Logic:
  # Instead of simple round-robin, use work estimation
  tasks = [
    {file: "file1.ts", estimated_time: 5min, complexity: "medium"},
    {file: "file2.ts", estimated_time: 2min, complexity: "low"},
    {file: "file3.ts", estimated_time: 8min, complexity: "high"},
    {file: "file4.ts", estimated_time: 3min, complexity: "medium"},
    {file: "file5.ts", estimated_time: 4min, complexity: "medium"},
    {file: "file6.ts", estimated_time: 6min, complexity: "high"},
    {file: "file7.ts", estimated_time: 2min, complexity: "low"}
  ]
  
  # Optimal distribution for 3 agents (total: 30min → 10min each)
  Agent 1: [file3.ts(8min), file7.ts(2min)] = 10min
  Agent 2: [file6.ts(6min), file4.ts(3min)] = 9min  
  Agent 3: [file1.ts(5min), file5.ts(4min), file2.ts(2min)] = 11min

Affinity-Based Assignment:
  principle: Assign similar tasks to same instance for context reuse
  patterns:
    - Same file type → same agent (*.tsx files to agent 1)
    - Similar complexity → same agent (complex files to specialized agent)
    - Related components → same agent (UserList, UserCard to same agent)
    - Shared dependencies → same agent (files importing same modules)
  
  benefits:
    - Reduced context switching overhead
    - Better pattern recognition and consistency
    - Improved code quality through specialization
    - Faster execution due to context reuse

Round-Robin Fallback:
  - When work estimation unavailable
  - Ensures even distribution
  - Minimizes idle time
  - Allows work stealing if one finishes early
```

### Parallelization Patterns

**Research Parallelization**:
```yaml
Pattern: Parallel context gathering
Execution:
  - Project analysis agents work independently
  - Technology research agents work independently
  - Pattern discovery agents work independently
Coordination: None during execution, results aggregated for planning
Benefits: 3-5x speedup in context gathering phase
```

**Implementation Parallelization**:
```yaml
Pattern: Independent specialist execution
Execution:
  - Different specialists work on different files
  - Clear component boundaries prevent conflicts
  - Integration points defined upfront in planning
Coordination: File-level ownership, integration validation at completion
Benefits: 4-6x speedup through parallel implementation
```

**Quality Parallelization**:
```yaml
Pattern: Parallel validation when complexity requires it
Execution:
  - Test creation specialists work independently
  - Quality validation specialists check different aspects
  - Security and performance validation in parallel
Coordination: Result aggregation and combined reporting
Benefits: 5-10x speedup in validation phases
```

### Load Balancing Strategy

**Enhanced Automatic Distribution**:
```yaml
Intelligent Task Routing:
  - Route tasks to most appropriate specialist type
  - Balance workload across available instances using work estimation
  - Prefer agents with relevant context and capacity
  - Apply affinity-based routing for related tasks
  - Avoid overloading any single agent or specialization

Predictive Scaling Strategy:
  adaptive_spawning:
    - Start with 1 instance, scale to 3 as workload increases
    - Spawn instances based on queue depth and complexity analysis
    - Consider context transfer overhead in scaling decisions
    
  scale_up_triggers:
    - Queue depth > 5 tasks with high complexity
    - Average wait time > 2x estimated task completion time
    - Agent utilization > 85% for sustained period
    
  scale_down_triggers:
    - Agent idle > 30% of time for 5+ minutes
    - Queue depth < 2 tasks for sustained period
    - Overall system utilization < 60%

Enhanced Work Stealing:
  cross_specialization_stealing:
    - Idle specialists can adapt to help overloaded specialists
    - Context transfer protocols for seamless handoffs
    - Priority-based task redistribution
    
  intelligent_redistribution:
    - Consider task complexity and agent capability
    - Minimize context switching overhead
    - Maintain quality through appropriate specialist matching

```

### Coordination Mechanisms

**Minimal Coordination Strategy**:
```yaml

  - Integration interface contracts
  - Quality gate validation
  - Final result aggregation and synthesis
```

### Scope-Based Parallelization

**Project Scope Patterns**:
```yaml
Independent Scopes:
  pattern: Complete independence across different project areas
  examples: authentication, payments, analytics, interface, services
  coordination: None during execution, integration validation at boundaries
  benefits: Near-linear speedup based on number of independent scopes

Intra-Scope Parallelization:
  pattern: Parallel work within single scope on different components
  examples: multiple files, different components, separate test types
  coordination: Shared interfaces and contracts only
  benefits: 3-5x speedup within scope boundaries

Cross-Scope Integration:
  pattern: Parallel boundary validation and integration testing
  timing: After scope-specific work completion
  coordination: Automated integration tests and contract validation
  benefits: Fast integration verification without blocking development
