# Parallel Execution Module

## Purpose
Essential parallel execution strategies for efficient Guild system performance. This module is embedded into the setup command.

## Embedded Intelligence

### Core Parallelization Philosophy

**Simple Parallel Strategy**: Work in parallel when tasks are independent, coordinate only at integration boundaries.

**Default Settings**:
```yaml
Concurrency Limits:
  per_agent_type: 3 instances (configurable)
  total_parallel: 20 agents maximum (configurable)
  load_balancing: automatic task distribution
  resource_management: dynamic scaling based on workload

Parallelization Triggers:
  independent_tasks: Always parallelize when no dependencies exist
  different_files: Parallel work on separate files within same scope
  different_components: Parallel work on independent components
  different_scopes: Complete independence across project areas
```

### Same-Agent Multiple Instance Parallelization

**Core Concept**: Spawn multiple instances of the SAME specialist agent to process independent tasks in parallel.

**Automatic Instance Spawning**:
```yaml
When Planning Agent Detects:
  - Multiple files needing same type of modification
  - Independent components requiring same specialist
  - Batch operations on similar code patterns
  - Parallel test creation for multiple modules

Spawning Strategy:
  1. Planning agent identifies N similar tasks
  2. Spawns min(N, 3) instances of same specialist
  3. Distributes tasks evenly across instances
  4. Each instance works independently on assigned files
```

**Real-World Examples**:
```yaml
Example 1 - Interface Specialist (3 instances):
  Instance 1: Updates UserList.tsx, UserCard.tsx
  Instance 2: Updates ProductList.tsx, ProductCard.tsx  
  Instance 3: Updates OrderList.tsx, OrderCard.tsx
  Result: 3x faster than sequential processing

Example 2 - Service Specialist (3 instances):
  Instance 1: Implements user.service.ts
  Instance 2: Implements product.service.ts
  Instance 3: Implements order.service.ts
  Result: Complete service layer in 1/3 time

Example 3 - Test Specialist (3 instances):
  Instance 1: Creates tests for components A-F
  Instance 2: Creates tests for components G-L
  Instance 3: Creates tests for components M-R
  Result: Full test coverage 3x faster
```

**Task Distribution Algorithm**:
```yaml
Distribution Logic:
  tasks = [file1, file2, file3, file4, file5, file6, file7]
  agents = 3
  
  Agent 1: [file1, file4, file7]
  Agent 2: [file2, file5]
  Agent 3: [file3, file6]
  
Round-Robin Assignment:
  - Ensures even distribution
  - Minimizes idle time
  - Allows work stealing if one finishes early
```

### Parallelization Patterns

**Research Parallelization**:
```yaml
Pattern: Parallel context gathering
Execution:
  - Project analysis agents work independently
  - Technology research agents work independently
  - Pattern discovery agents work independently
Coordination: None during execution, results aggregated for planning
Benefits: 3-5x speedup in context gathering phase
```

**Implementation Parallelization**:
```yaml
Pattern: Independent specialist execution
Execution:
  - Different specialists work on different files
  - Clear component boundaries prevent conflicts
  - Integration points defined upfront in planning
Coordination: File-level ownership, integration validation at completion
Benefits: 4-6x speedup through parallel implementation
```

**Quality Parallelization**:
```yaml
Pattern: Parallel validation when complexity requires it
Execution:
  - Test creation specialists work independently
  - Quality validation specialists check different aspects
  - Security and performance validation in parallel
Coordination: Result aggregation and combined reporting
Benefits: 5-10x speedup in validation phases
```

### Load Balancing Strategy

**Automatic Distribution**:
```yaml
Task Routing:
  - Route tasks to most appropriate specialist type
  - Balance workload across available instances
  - Prefer agents with relevant context and capacity
  - Avoid overloading any single agent or specialization

Dynamic Scaling:
  scale_up: Create new instances when workload exceeds capacity
  scale_down: Terminate idle instances to conserve resources
  work_stealing: Idle agents help with overflow from busy specialists
  resource_optimization: Continuous monitoring and adjustment

Performance Monitoring:
  - Track agent utilization and performance
  - Monitor resource usage and system capacity
  - Identify bottlenecks and rebalance accordingly
  - Optimize context transfer and communication
```

### Coordination Mechanisms

**Minimal Coordination Strategy**:
```yaml
Independence Principle:
  - Agents work independently whenever possible
  - Shared state minimized to essential integration points
  - Communication through asynchronous progress reporting
  - Conflict resolution through ownership rules

Boundary Management:
  planning_phase: Define interfaces and contracts upfront
  execution_phase: Validate integration points at completion
  quality_phase: Apply consistent validation across all work
  feedback_phase: Report issues and coordinate resolution

Coordination Points:
  - File ownership and modification rights
  - Integration interface contracts
  - Quality gate validation
  - Final result aggregation and synthesis
```

### Scope-Based Parallelization

**Project Scope Patterns**:
```yaml
Independent Scopes:
  pattern: Complete independence across different project areas
  examples: authentication, payments, analytics, interface, services
  coordination: None during execution, integration validation at boundaries
  benefits: Near-linear speedup based on number of independent scopes

Intra-Scope Parallelization:
  pattern: Parallel work within single scope on different components
  examples: multiple files, different components, separate test types
  coordination: Shared interfaces and contracts only
  benefits: 3-5x speedup within scope boundaries

Cross-Scope Integration:
  pattern: Parallel boundary validation and integration testing
  timing: After scope-specific work completion
  coordination: Automated integration tests and contract validation
  benefits: Fast integration verification without blocking development
```

### Adaptive Parallelization

**Claude-Driven Optimization**:
```yaml
Dynamic Assessment:
  - Claude analyzes project structure and complexity
  - Determines optimal parallelization strategy
  - Adjusts based on available resources and constraints
  - Monitors performance and adjusts in real-time

Complexity-Based Scaling:
  simple_projects: Minimal parallelization (2-3 agents)
  medium_projects: Balanced parallelization (5-10 agents)
  large_projects: Aggressive parallelization (10-20 agents)
  enterprise_projects: Maximum parallelization (up to limits)

Performance Optimization:
  - Intelligent work distribution
  - Context optimization for parallel agents
  - Resource pooling and sharing
  - Bottleneck identification and resolution
```

### Error Handling and Recovery

**Parallel Error Management**:
```yaml
Failure Isolation:
  - Scope-level failure containment
  - Continue other work on localized failures
  - Graceful degradation with partial success
  - Clear reporting of failed vs. successful work

Recovery Strategies:
  automatic_retry: Retry failed tasks with exponential backoff
  fallback_sequential: Fall back to sequential execution on conflicts
  checkpoint_restart: Resume from last successful checkpoint
  partial_rollback: Rollback only affected components

Conflict Resolution:
  detection: Real-time monitoring for file and resource conflicts
  prevention: Ownership rules and boundary definitions
  resolution: Automatic resolution for simple conflicts
  escalation: Manual intervention for complex conflicts
```
