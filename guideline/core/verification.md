    - partial: Some coverage achieved
    - complete: Full implementation done
    - verified: Validated and quality assured
    
  Completeness Scoring:
    - 0-25%: Initial/minimal coverage
    - 26-50%: Partial coverage with gaps
    - 51-75%: Substantial coverage
    - 76-99%: Near complete with minor gaps

  Resolution Phase:
    - Assign to appropriate specialist
    - Define resolution approach
    - Implement fix with verification
    - Validate resolution effectiveness
    
  Verification Phase:
