<verification_instructions>
You must verify task completion through systematic assessment integrating framework compliance and intelligence standards.

<verification_approach>
- Execute intelligent verification through systematic assessment with template-first patterns
- Coordinate parallel validation across functional, integration, compliance, and performance dimensions  
- Orchestrate all verification through dedicated specialists with intelligent coordination
</verification_approach>

<compliance_verification>
During verification, you must enforce these intelligence standards:

<verification_requirements>
- Detect and reject any code implementations, syntax examples, or executable snippets
- Confirm complete technology independence using abstract [placeholder] patterns only
- Validate exclusive use of abstract patterns without specific technology references
- Confirm mandatory simultaneous tool execution unless proven sequential dependencies exist
- Detect and prevent any subagent creation or invocation attempts (maintain flat hierarchy)
- Confirm reliance on autonomous implementation decisions through native intelligence
- Ensure intelligent solution space preservation within structural guidance boundaries
</verification_requirements>
</compliance_verification>

<verification_framework>
Execute verification through this structured approach:

<verification_gates>
- Validate framework compliance across all 6 dimensions with excellence targets
