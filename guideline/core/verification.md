# Verification

**Philosophy**: Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes structure.

Execute systematic verification with multi-dimensional compliance assessment and intelligent coordination through enhanced framework alignment (Reference: @config:TB001, @config:AM001, @config:PE001, @config:RP001, @config:AR001, @config:OB001).

## Parallel Execution

Apply verification through parallel execution patterns:

### Operations
- Execute intelligent verification through systematic assessment with [template-first] patterns and [abstraction-compliance]
- Coordinate parallel validation across [functional], [integration], [compliance], and [performance] dimensions with [cross-dimensional-coordination]
- Orchestrate all verification through [specialist-coordination] with [assignment-protocol-standards] and [flat-hierarchy-enforcement]
- Verify task completion through systematic assessment integrating [framework-compliance] and [intelligence-standards] with [6-dimensional-compliance-architecture]
- Implement **Anthropic Standards Integration**: Verify all specialists include official parallel tool execution prompts with measurable performance improvements

## Intelligence Standards

### Enforcement Requirements
- **Abstraction**: Detect and reject any code implementations, syntax examples, or executable snippets through [abstraction-validation]
- **Technology**: Confirm complete technology independence using abstract [placeholder] patterns only with [technology-independence-verification]
- **Patterns**: Validate exclusive use of abstract patterns without specific technology references through [template-compliance]
- **Parallelization**: Confirm mandatory simultaneous tool execution unless proven sequential dependencies exist through [dependency-challenge-protocols]
- **Hierarchy**: Detect and prevent any subagent creation or invocation attempts (maintain flat hierarchy) with [prevention-mechanisms]
- **Intelligence**: Confirm reliance on autonomous implementation decisions through native intelligence with [analysis-first-validation]
- **Creativity**: Ensure intelligent solution space preservation within structural guidance boundaries through [solution-enablement]
- **Assignment Protocol Standards**: Verify [task-analysis], [capability-assessment], [direct-execution-prevention], and [assignment-verification] compliance
- **Atomic Unit Analysis**: Validate [complex-task] decomposition into smallest parallelizable [work-units] through systematic breakdown
