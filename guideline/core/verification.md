# Verification Framework

## Purpose
**MANDATORY AGENT VERIFICATION**: ALL verification tasks must be executed through specialized verification agents. No direct verification allowed.

## Agent-Mandatory Verification Approach

**SYSTEMATIC VERIFICATION (via Verification Specialists):**
- Deploy understanding-verification specialist to confirm requirements before execution begins  
- Create gap-detection specialist to check for implementation gaps and missing requirements
- Use integration-validation specialist to validate integration points and coordination effectiveness
- Coordinate iteration specialists to improve until user satisfaction achieved
- Use completion-verification specialist to ensure user confirmation before considering work complete

## Verification Domains

**CORE VERIFICATION AREAS:**
- **Functional**: Requirements met, deliverables complete, workflows operational
- **Integration**: Components connect properly, data flows correctly, interfaces work
- **Quality**: Standards followed, best practices applied, documentation complete
- **Performance**: Efficiency targets met, resource usage optimized
- **User Satisfaction**: Needs met, expectations fulfilled, outcomes valuable

**VERIFICATION EXECUTION:**
- Multiple verification areas can be checked simultaneously
- Coordinate results across different verification streams
- Prioritize critical areas while ensuring comprehensive coverage
- Integrate findings to identify cross-domain issues

## Success Criteria

**COMPLETION STANDARDS:**
- **Functional**: All requirements implemented and working correctly  
- **Integration**: All components connected and communicating properly
- **Quality**: Standards met, best practices followed, documentation complete
- **Performance**: Efficiency targets achieved, resource usage optimized
- **User Acceptance**: User confirms satisfaction with deliverables

**VALIDATION APPROACH:**
- Check all verification areas systematically
- Coordinate findings across different verification streams  
- Resolve conflicts and inconsistencies between areas
- Ensure success across all critical domains before completion

## Gap Detection and Remediation

**SYSTEMATIC GAP IDENTIFICATION:**
1. **Analyze Coverage**: Review each verification domain for completeness
2. **Identify Gaps**: Find missing features, broken integrations, quality issues
3. **Prioritize Issues**: Focus on critical gaps that affect core functionality  
4. **Plan Remediation**: Design approach to address identified gaps
5. **Execute Fixes**: Implement solutions and verify they resolve issues
6. **Validate Resolution**: Confirm gaps are fully addressed

**COMMON GAP PATTERNS:**
- **Functional**: Missing features, broken workflows, unmet requirements
- **Integration**: Connection failures, data flow issues, interface problems
- **Quality**: Standard violations, poor documentation, inadequate error handling
- **Performance**: Slow execution, resource waste, scalability problems

**REMEDIATION APPROACH:**
- Group related issues for efficient resolution
- Create targeted solutions for different gap types
- Coordinate fixes across multiple areas when needed
- Verify that fixes don't introduce new issues

## Best Practices

**SYSTEMATIC VERIFICATION:**
- Apply verification methodology consistently across all domains
- Check integration points and coordination effectiveness thoroughly
- Document findings clearly and prioritize critical issues
- Iterate improvements until user satisfaction achieved

**EXECUTION OPTIMIZATION:**
- Verify understanding before beginning execution
- Check work systematically during and after implementation
- Coordinate verification across multiple specialists when used
- Focus user interaction on confirmation and satisfaction

**QUALITY ASSURANCE:**
- Maintain consistent standards across all verification activities
- Track patterns of success and areas for improvement  
- Apply lessons learned to enhance future verification approaches
- Ensure verification results enhance rather than burden the process

**CLEAN VERIFICATION:**
- Keep verification results and analysis in conversation
- Only create files when explicitly requested by user
- Focus on actionable findings that improve outcomes
- Ensure verification adds value without creating unnecessary artifacts
