# Verification

## Purpose
Intelligent verification integrating task completion with framework compliance and mandatory intelligence standards.

## Core Philosophy

**Intelligence-Driven Validation**: Verification enables excellence through systematic assessment with template-first patterns.
**Multi-Domain Coordination**: Parallel validation across functional, integration, compliance, and performance dimensions.
**Specialist-Orchestrated Excellence**: All verification through dedicated specialists with intelligent coordination.

## Mandatory Intelligence Compliance

**VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT**: All verification protocols must enforce mandatory intelligence standards:

- **Code Sample Prohibition**: Verification must detect and reject any code implementations or syntax examples
- **Technology Abstraction**: Verification must confirm complete technology independence using abstract patterns
- **Template Compliance**: Verification must validate exclusive use of `[placeholder]` patterns
- **Tool Parallelization Compliance**: Verification must confirm mandatory simultaneous tool execution unless proven dependencies exist
- **Agent Recursion Prevention**: Verification must detect and prevent any subagent creation or invocation attempts
- **Native Intelligence Validation**: Verification must confirm reliance on autonomous implementation decisions
- **Creative Solution Protection**: Verification must ensure intelligent solution space preservation
