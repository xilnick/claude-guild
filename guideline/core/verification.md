# Natural Verification

## Purpose
Ensure tasks are completed correctly using Claude's natural verification abilities with **MANDATORY** iteration until user satisfaction, following Tool Use Implementation standards. Integrates with consolidated intelligence patterns for agent verification and quality assurance across all agent types.

## Core Parallel Verification Principle

<principle>
  **SYSTEMATIC PARALLEL VERIFICATION APPROACH:**
  Trust Claude to naturally verify work quality with MANDATORY parallel verification:
  - CONFIRM understanding before ANY execution (see workflow.md)
  - DECOMPOSE verification into parallel verification specialists
  - CHECK for implementation gaps through parallel validation streams
  - COORDINATE verification results across all parallel work
  - ITERATE until user is fully satisfied using parallel improvement approach
  - NEVER consider work complete without explicit user confirmation
  - DEFAULT: Parallel verification as standard practice, not optimization
</principle>
