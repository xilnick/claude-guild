# Intelligence Boundaries Framework - Guild System

## Purpose
Establishes clear boundaries for when structure governs decisions vs when intelligence has autonomy, resolving the tension between "systematic methodology" and "native intelligence" in the Guild framework. Integrates with consolidated intelligence architecture through `@guideline/core/intelligence-tracker.md` for boundary consistency monitoring and `@guideline/core/subagent-invocation.md` for intelligent agent selection patterns.

## Core Philosophy: Complementary Intelligence Layers

**Fundamental Principle**: Structure and Intelligence operate at different layers and serve different purposes.

- **STRUCTURE LAYER**: Provides reliability, safety, and comprehensive coverage
- **INTELLIGENCE LAYER**: Provides optimization, innovation, and adaptive excellence
- **INTEGRATION LAYER**: Harmonizes structure and intelligence for superior outcomes
- **EVOLUTION LAYER**: Uses intelligence insights to improve structural frameworks
