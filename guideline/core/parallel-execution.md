## Parallel Execution Architecture

### Scope-Based Parallelization

```yaml
Independent Scope Execution:
  Pattern: Each scope runs independently with own agents
  Example: auth ∥ payments ∥ analytics ∥ frontend ∥ backend
  Benefits:
    - 4-5x speedup for large projects
    - No context switching overhead
    - Optimal resource utilization
    - Independent failure isolation
  
  Coordination Mechanisms:
    - Boundary agents manage interfaces
    - Event-driven synchronization
    - Async message passing between scopes
    - Lock-free data structures for shared resources
    - Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)
  
  Scope Isolation:
    - Each scope has dedicated working directory
    - Independent git branches per scope (optional)
    - Separate context and state management
    - Isolated test execution environments
```

### Agent Pool Management

```yaml
Dynamic Agent Pools:
  Per-Scope Pools:
    - Dedicated agents per scope
    - No context switching overhead
    - Optimal memory locality
    - Scope-specific caching
    sizing: 1-3 agents per scope based on complexity
    
  Shared Resource Pool:
    - Common utilities (verification, testing)
    - Load-balanced allocation
    - Priority-based scheduling
    - Elastic scaling based on demand
    sizing: 20% of total scope agents
    
  Scaling Strategy:
    initial: 1 agent per scope
    scale_up_trigger: scope_complexity > threshold
    scale_down_trigger: idle_time > 30s
    maximum: number_of_scopes * 2
    minimum: number_of_scopes
    
  Resource Allocation:
    cpu_per_agent: 1-2 cores
    memory_per_agent: 256-512MB
    max_total_memory: 4GB
    max_total_cpu: 80% available
```

### Parallel Stage Execution

```yaml

    protocols:
      - Fire-and-forget for notifications
      - Request-response for queries

      - Final aggregation points
    strategies:
      - Optimistic execution with rollback
      - Pessimistic locking for critical sections
      - Lock-free algorithms where possible
      - Wait-free data structures for hot paths
    
  Conflict Resolution:
    detection:
      - Real-time file monitoring
      - Dependency graph analysis
      - Resource usage tracking
      - Change impact assessment
    resolution:
      - Optimistic locking with retry
      - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
      - Conflict-free replicated data types
      - Three-way merge for compatible changes
      - Manual escalation for complex conflicts
    
  Event-Driven Coordination:
    events:
      - scope_analysis_complete
      - boundary_validation_required
      - conflict_detected
      - integration_point_modified
    handlers:

      - Event sourcing for audit
      - Event replay for recovery
      - Event filtering and routing
```

## Execution Optimization

### Performance Strategies

```yaml
Optimization Techniques:
  
  Work Stealing:
    - Idle agents steal work from busy scopes
    - Dynamic load balancing
    - Minimize total execution time
    - Prevent resource starvation
    
  Pipeline Optimization:
    - Start downstream stages early
    - Overlap I/O with computation
    - Prefetch likely needed resources
    - Speculative execution for common paths
    
  Cache Optimization:
    - Scope-local caches
    - Shared read-only cache
    - Cache warming strategies
    - Intelligent cache invalidation
    
  Resource Pooling:
    - Connection pooling for APIs

```

    simple_project:
      parallel_agents: 2-3
      strategy: minimal_parallelization
      coordination: simple_synchronization

```

## Parallel Execution Patterns

### Map-Reduce Pattern

```yaml
Pattern: Map-Reduce for Scope Analysis
  Map Phase:
    - Distribute scopes to agents
    - Parallel analysis execution
    - Independent result generation
    
  Reduce Phase:
    - Collect scope results
    - Merge and deduplicate
    - Generate unified view
    
  Example:
    map: analyze_scope(scope) for each scope
    reduce: merge_analyses(results) into project_profile
```

### Fork-Join Pattern

```yaml
Pattern: Fork-Join for Implementation
  Fork Phase:
    - Split work by scope
    - Create parallel tasks
    - Assign to agent pools
    
  Join Phase:
    - Wait for scope completion
    - Validate integration points
    - Merge changes
    
  Example:
    fork: implement_scope(scope, plan) for each scope
    join: validate_and_merge(implementations)
```

### Pipeline Pattern

```yaml
Pattern: Pipeline for Continuous Processing
  Stages:
    - Stage 1: Scope discovery
    - Stage 2: Agent generation
    - Stage 3: Planning
    - Stage 4: Implementation
    
  Flow:
    - Each scope flows through pipeline
    - Stages execute in parallel
    - Different scopes in different stages
    
  Example:
    scope1: discovery → generation → planning → implementation
    scope2:           discovery → generation → planning
    scope3:                     discovery → generation
```

  Recovery Strategies:
    - Automatic retry with backoff
    - Fallback to sequential execution
    - Checkpoint and restart
