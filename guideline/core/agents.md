# Agent Creation & Character Framework

## 🔒 MANDATORY Agent Creation Requirements

### Dynamic Agent Creation (CRITICAL)
**ALL workflows MUST support dynamic agent creation:**
- **CREATE** agents dynamically during workflow execution
- **NO** pre-existing setup required for task execution  
- **SPECIALIZE** based on discovered task requirements
- **EMBED** project-specific knowledge and patterns
- **INTEGRATE** verification capabilities in all agents

### Optional Persistent Agent Setup
**Setup command creates persistent agents when desired:**
- **OPTIONAL** - not required for workflow execution
- **OPTIMIZE** repeated similar tasks through reuse
- **STORE** in `.claude/agents/guild/` directory  
- **MAINTAIN** project-specific specialization
- **PRESERVE** verification integration

### Intelligence-Driven Creation (MANDATORY)
**NO predetermined templates allowed:**
- **RESEARCH** project characteristics thoroughly
- **ANALYZE** technology stack and architecture  
- **DISCOVER** natural specialist boundaries
- **EMBED** actual project patterns and conventions
- **VALIDATE** agent contains appropriate expertise

## Agent Creation Intelligence

**Create specialists dynamically based on actual project needs:**
- **Analyze** project to identify natural specialist boundaries
- **Build** agents with clear roles, embedded project knowledge  
- **Establish** coordination protocols and quality standards
- **Optimize** team composition for task complexity

## Character Consistency (Anthropic Guidelines)

**Simple character definitions with consistent traits:**
- **Define** clear role and expertise area for each agent
- **Establish** communication style and decision-making approach  
- **Set** boundaries for responsibilities vs escalations
- **Embed** project-specific patterns and knowledge
- **Trust** Claude's native character consistency abilities

**Character Pattern:**
```
Role: {project-specific expertise}
Traits: {key characteristics}  
Style: {communication approach}
Scope: {responsibilities vs escalations}
Knowledge: {embedded project context}
```

**Maintain character through:**
- Clear role definition in system prompt
- Consistent communication style and vocabulary  
- Natural trait demonstration in problem-solving
- Boundary adherence with graceful handoffs

## Agent Selection Patterns

**Match agents to actual task requirements:**
- **Simple tasks**: Single specialist with project knowledge
- **Multi-component**: Coordinated specialists with clear boundaries  
- **Complex architecture**: Research + implementation + integration specialists
- **Quality-critical**: Additional verification and testing specialists

## Character Definition Commands

**Create agents with consistent personas:**
- **Define** clear role and expertise area
- **Establish** communication style and decision-making approach  
- **Set** boundaries for responsibilities vs escalations
- **Embed** project-specific patterns and knowledge

## Verification Framework Integration

**🔒 MANDATORY: ALL agents MUST embed verification capabilities**
- **INTEGRATE** coverage tracking in agent workflows
- **EMBED** gap detection intelligence in specialists  
- **ESTABLISH** quality validation approaches
- **DEFINE** clear satisfaction criteria
- **ENABLE** progressive validation throughout execution

**Required verification capabilities:**
- **Coverage awareness**: Track area completion status
- **Gap detection**: Identify missing or incomplete work
- **Quality standards**: Project-specific validation criteria  
- **Satisfaction metrics**: Multi-dimensional completion assessment
- **Integration testing**: Cross-component validation

## Quality Integration Commands

**Embed verification into all specialists:**
- **BUILD** validation into each specialist's workflow
- **ESTABLISH** quality standards specific to domain expertise
- **CREATE** coordination protocols for cross-agent validation  
- **ENSURE** comprehensive coverage across all specialist work
- **VALIDATE** gap-free delivery before completion

## Success Criteria

**Agents must achieve:**
- ✅ Perfect match to project requirements
- ✅ Clear boundaries preventing conflicts
- ✅ Embedded project knowledge and quality standards  
- ✅ Natural coordination through specialist expertise
- ✅ Comprehensive verification capabilities integrated
- ✅ Dynamic creation without setup dependencies
