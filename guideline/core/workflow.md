# Research & Intelligence-Driven Team Orchestration Module

## Core Philosophy

**🧠 INTELLIGENCE-FIRST EXECUTION**: Always ultrathink first, research unknowns, plan with precision, get approval, then execute.

**🎯 RESEARCH-DRIVEN COORDINATION**: Main thread coordinates through deep analysis and systematic investigation.

**🏢 SCOPED PARALLEL LEADERSHIP**: Intelligent team activation with file/directory scope assignments for optimal efficiency.

**⚡ APPROVAL-GATED EXECUTION**: Never execute without explicit user approval of comprehensive plans.

**🚀 RESULTS-FOCUSED COLLABORATION**: Teams organized around delivering specific, well-researched project outcomes.
