# Simple Workflow Module
**Version**: 9.0.0 | **Last Updated**: 2025-08-28 | **Dependencies**: agents.md

## Purpose
Intelligence-first workflow: ultrathink reasoning → comprehensive MCP research → maximum parallel execution.

## Core Philosophy

**🧠 PURE INTELLIGENCE**: Claude's intelligence determines ALL parallelization decisions - no hardcoded rules.

**🔍 RESEARCH-DRIVEN**: Comprehensive MCP research creates shared knowledge base.

**🛑 APPROVAL REQUIRED**: Always present execution plan and wait for user confirmation.

**⚡ MAXIMUM PARALLELIZATION**: Default to maximum parallel execution for speed.

**🧬 COGNITIVE SPECIALIZATION**: Agents use specialized thinking approaches.

**🧠 INTELLIGENT COORDINATION**: Intelligence prevents conflicts and manages dependencies.

## Three-Phase Intelligence-Driven Execution

### Phase 1: Ultrathink Everything (MANDATORY)

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Ultrathink reasoning is **NON-NEGOTIABLE** - Never skip this phase.

**Intelligence Discovers:**
- **Task Understanding**: What exactly needs to be accomplished
- **Parallelization Opportunities**: Every possible parallel execution unit
- **Agent Distribution**: How many agents and where they work
- **Dependency Analysis**: What must be sequential vs parallel
- **Conflict Prevention**: How to prevent file/resource conflicts

**Ultrathink Process:**
1. **Analyze Task**: Understand user requirements completely
2. **Discover Parallelization**: Find every possible parallel execution unit
3. **Assign Agents**: Intelligence determines optimal agent distribution
4. **Plan Execution**: Default parallel unless dependencies block
5. **Present Plan**: Get user approval before execution

**Intelligence-Only Decision Making:**
- No hardcoded rules or limits
- Pure Claude reasoning determines everything
- Maximum parallelization by default
- Trust intelligence to prevent conflicts

## Simplified Execution Strategy

**Default Strategy: Maximum Parallelization**

Intelligence determines:
- How many agents to create
- Which files/areas each agent owns  
- How to prevent conflicts between agents
- When sequencing is absolutely necessary

No rules, algorithms, or limits - pure Claude intelligence decides everything.

### Phase 2: Research Everything Once (MANDATORY)

**Intelligence-Driven Research:**
1. **Discover Technologies**: Intelligence identifies ALL project technologies
2. **Research Comprehensively**: Use MCP tools (context7, WebSearch, WebFetch)
3. **Share Knowledge**: All agents access same research cache
4. **No Redundancy**: Research once, use everywhere

**Shared Research Cache:**
- All agents access same knowledge base
- No duplicate research across agents
- Intelligence ensures complete coverage

### Phase 3: Maximum Parallel Execution

**Intelligence-Only Execution:**
1. **Launch All Agents**: Start maximum parallel agents based on intelligence analysis
2. **Prevent Conflicts**: Intelligence assigns exclusive file ownership
3. **Coordinate Dependencies**: Only sequence when absolutely necessary
4. **Trust Intelligence**: No hardcoded coordination rules
  parallel_coordination: all_chains_run_simultaneously
  agents_per_chain: 3-7 agents
```

## Intelligence-Based Research

**MCP Research Tools:**
- **context7**: Library documentation and code examples
- **WebSearch**: Community patterns and best practices  
- **WebFetch**: Official API documentation

**Intelligence Manages:**
- Which technologies to research
- How comprehensive research needs to be
- Which agents need which research
- When research is complete

## Cognitive Agent Coordination

**Pure Intelligence Coordination:**
- Intelligence determines agent count and assignment
- Intelligence prevents conflicts through file ownership
- Intelligence decides parallel vs sequential execution
- Intelligence integrates results into coherent solution

**No Hardcoded Rules:**
- No agent count limits
- No scaling algorithms
- No execution mode formulas
- Pure Claude reasoning drives everything

## Success Criteria

- ✅ **Intelligence-First**: Pure Claude intelligence drives all decisions
- ✅ **Maximum Parallelization**: Default to maximum parallel execution for speed
- ✅ **Simple Execution**: Clean three-phase workflow without complex rules
- ✅ **Conflict-Free**: Intelligence prevents conflicts through smart file assignment
- ✅ **Research Integration**: Comprehensive MCP research shared across all agents
- ✅ **User Approval**: No execution without explicit user confirmation
