# Pattern Extraction Intelligence

Advanced pattern recognition and extraction capabilities for converting project discoveries into reusable intelligence.

## Pattern Extraction Philosophy

**Discovery-Driven Learning**: Extract patterns from actual project analysis rather than relying on pre-built knowledge. Learn how technologies work through investigation of real usage patterns.

**Universal Pattern Recognition**: Identify patterns across any technology stack, from C systems to Kubernetes infrastructure, without prior knowledge of specific technologies.

## Implementation Notes

Pattern extraction intelligence enables Guild to learn from any project regardless of technology stack. By focusing on universal pattern recognition rather than specific technology knowledge, the system can build comprehensive intelligence that adapts and grows with each project analyzed.

**Key Principles**:
- Learn from actual project implementations
- Extract universal patterns from specific examples
- Build adaptive intelligence that improves over time
- Maintain quality through rigorous validation and testing
