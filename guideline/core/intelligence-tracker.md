# Intelligence Tracker - Guild System

## Purpose
Monitors intelligence consistency across core modules, commands, and workflows. Ensures patterns remain coherent, dependencies are managed, and evolution is tracked.

## Core Philosophy
**Fundamental Principle**: Maintain intelligence consistency through systematic tracking and evolution monitoring.

**TRACKING AREAS:**
- Intelligence pattern consistency across modules
- Cross-module dependencies and reference integrity
- Intelligence pattern improvements and adaptations
- Quality standards maintenance across components

## Intelligence Source Mapping

<intelligence_mapping>
  **CORE MODULE INTELLIGENCE DISTRIBUTION:**
  
  **Primary Sources:**
  - `subagent-invocation.md`: Discovery protocol, scoring system, adaptation templates
  - `agents.md`: Creation methodology, specialist patterns, coordination architecture
  - `workflow.md`: Orchestration, parallel execution, autonomous analysis
  - `verification.md`: Parallel verification, gap detection, quality criteria
  
  **Command Intelligence:**
  - `setup-command.md`: Consumes creation patterns → Produces agent architectures
  - `workflow-command.md`: Consumes discovery patterns → Produces execution patterns
</intelligence_mapping>

## Cross-Module Dependency Matrix

<dependency_matrix>
  **DEPENDENCY PATHS:**
  ```
  subagent-invocation ←→ agents ←→ workflow ←→ verification
           ↑                                    ↓
     setup-command ←→ workflow-command ←→ intelligence-tracker
  ```
  
  **VALIDATION CHECKLIST:**
  - ✅ Reference integrity: All module references resolve correctly
  - ✅ Pattern consistency: Referenced patterns match source definitions
  - ✅ Version alignment: All modules reference current patterns
  - ✅ No circular dependencies: Clear reference paths maintained
  - ✅ Coverage completeness: All required patterns have sources
  
  **HEALTH INDICATORS:**
  - **Healthy**: Clear paths, consistent patterns, no broken references
  - **Warning**: Circular patterns emerging, inconsistent definitions, orphaned patterns
  - **Critical**: Broken references, contradictory patterns, missing dependencies
