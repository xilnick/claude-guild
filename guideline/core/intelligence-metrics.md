# Intelligence Metrics Framework

## Purpose
Track effectiveness of specialist selection, coordination patterns, and execution approaches to enable continuous improvement.

## Core Philosophy
**Principle**: Measure what matters for optimization.

## Key Metrics

**SPECIALIST EFFECTIVENESS:**
- Selection accuracy (right specialist for the task)
- Reuse efficiency (existing vs new specialist creation)
- Coordination success (integration and handoff quality)
- Execution quality (deliverable completeness and user satisfaction)

**PROCESS OPTIMIZATION:**
- Decomposition effectiveness (parallel opportunity identification)
- Execution speed (time to completion)
- Resource efficiency (effort vs outcome ratio)
- Learning application (pattern recognition and reuse)

## Measurement Approach

**QUALITATIVE INDICATORS:**
- Task completion success rate
- User satisfaction with deliverables
- Specialist coordination effectiveness  
- Framework adherence and adaptation success

**QUANTITATIVE TRACKING:**
- Specialist selection vs task compatibility scores
- Parallel execution vs sequential execution efficiency
- Reuse rates vs creation rates by domain
- Time to completion trends over similar tasks

## Continuous Improvement

**LEARNING CYCLE:**
1. **Track**: Collect metrics during execution
2. **Analyze**: Identify patterns and improvement opportunities  
3. **Adapt**: Refine selection and coordination approaches
4. **Apply**: Use insights to improve future performance
