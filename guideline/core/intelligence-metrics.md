# Intelligence Metrics - Guild System

## Purpose
Quantitative tracking of agent selection, utilization effectiveness, and intelligence evolution patterns for continuous optimization.

## Core Philosophy
**Fundamental Principle**: What gets measured gets optimized.

**TRACKING AREAS:**
- Agent selection decisions and outcomes
- Persistent vs dynamic agent success rates  
- Execution quality, speed, and efficiency
- Intelligence pattern improvements over time
- Command-level intelligence usage

## Agent Selection Metrics

<agent_selection_metrics>
  **TRACKING FRAMEWORK:**
  - [track-selection-distribution] Score ranges (85-100, 70-84, 55-69, 40-54, <40)
  - [track-pattern-analysis] Utilization rates and selection accuracy
  - [track-performance-correlation] Score vs success rate, execution time, quality
</agent_selection_metrics>

## Utilization Effectiveness Tracking

<utilization_effectiveness>
  **REUSE EFFICIENCY:**
  - [track-agent-utilization] Creation vs reuse rates by domain
  - [track-effectiveness-comparison] Persistent vs dynamic vs hybrid performance
  - [track-optimization-insights] Under/over-utilized agents, missing domains
</utilization_effectiveness>

## Performance Benchmarking System

<performance_benchmarking>
  **QUALITY METRICS:**
  - [track-quality-dimensions] Technical excellence, requirement fulfillment, user satisfaction, coordination effectiveness
  - [track-speed-benchmarks] Agent selection time, execution speed, workflow efficiency  
  - [track-comparative-analysis] Before/after improvements, persistent vs dynamic performance
</performance_benchmarking>

## Intelligence Evolution Patterns

<intelligence_evolution>
  **EVOLUTION TRACKING:**
  - [track-pattern-discoveries] Successful patterns, effectiveness, replication success
  - [track-learning-integration] Pattern identification accuracy, adaptation speed
  - [track-predictive-insights] Demand forecasting, performance trends, optimization opportunities
</intelligence_evolution>

## Command-Level Intelligence Reporting

<command_reporting>
  **SETUP COMMAND METRICS:**
  - [track-agent-creation] Agent count, domain coverage, quality compliance
  - [track-handoff-preparation] Metadata quality, readiness for workflow
  
  **WORKFLOW COMMAND METRICS:**  
  - [track-discovery-performance] Agent discovery effectiveness, scoring accuracy
  - [track-execution-optimization] Parallel efficiency, coordination overhead, integration success
  
  **CROSS-COMMAND FLOW:**
  - [track-intelligence-handoff] Setup→workflow transfer effectiveness, feedback loops
</command_reporting>

## Real-Time Intelligence Dashboard

<intelligence_dashboard>
  **LIVE TRACKING:**
  - [display-session-metrics] Current agents in use, performance indicators
  - [display-trend-monitoring] Utilization trends, optimization opportunities  
  - [display-alert-system] Performance warnings, optimization notifications
</intelligence_dashboard>

## Continuous Improvement Protocol

<continuous_improvement>
  **ENHANCEMENT CYCLE:**
  1. **Data Collection** (Ongoing): Track agent selection, utilization, performance
  2. **Analysis** (Weekly): Identify optimization opportunities, evaluate benchmarks
  3. **Framework Enhancement** (Monthly): Integrate patterns, update algorithms  
  4. **Strategic Evolution** (Quarterly): Assess architecture, plan major enhancements
