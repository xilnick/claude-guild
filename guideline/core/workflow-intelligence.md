# Workflow Intelligence

**Philosophy**: Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes structure.

EXECUTE workflow operations through [task-coordination-intelligence] and [specialist-orchestration-protocols] with systematic dimensional integration (Reference: @config:TB001, @config:AM001, @config:PE001, @config:RP001, @config:AR001, @config:OB001).

**ARCHITECTURAL BOUNDARY**: Executes existing agents in parallel, NEVER creates them. Workflow = Agent Orchestra.
