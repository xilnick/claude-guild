# Workflow Intelligence

**Philosophy**: Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes structure.

EXECUTE workflow-specific intelligence through [task-coordination-frameworks] and [specialist-orchestration-protocols] with systematic execution and performance optimization (Reference: @config:TB001, @config:AM001, @config:PE001, @config:RP001, @config:AR001, @config:OB001).

## Task Execution Intelligence

COORDINATE [systematic-task-execution] through [specialist-orchestration] and [parallel-coordination-protocols].

APPLY execution intelligence through specialized patterns:

### Proactive Task Tool Deployment Intelligence

EXECUTE [immediate-task-tool-deployment] through [mandatory-first-action-protocols] and [zero-direct-execution-enforcement].

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Task tool deployment is the MANDATORY first action for ALL user requests:

#### Immediate Deployment Patterns
- **IMMEDIATELY** deploy Task tool as the very first action upon receiving any user request
- **NEVER** attempt task analysis, decomposition, or execution without first deploying Task tool
- **PROACTIVELY** select appropriate subagent_type based on request characteristics
- **AUTOMATICALLY** route ALL work through Task tool specialists - zero direct execution allowed

#### Subagent Selection Intelligence  
- **ANALYZE** user request type to determine optimal subagent_type (general-purpose, installation-deployment-specialist, etc.)
- **DEPLOY** Task tool with selected subagent_type immediately without hesitation or delay
- **COORDINATE** multiple Task tool deployments simultaneously for parallel task execution
- **ENSURE** every task component is handled by Task tool specialists

#### Proactive Deployment Enforcement
- **MANDATE** Task tool as the exclusive execution mechanism for all workflow operations
- **PREVENT** any direct execution attempts through systematic Task tool routing
- **VALIDATE** that all task activities flow through Task tool specialist coordination
- **OPTIMIZE** Task tool utilization through intelligent subagent type selection and parallel deployment
