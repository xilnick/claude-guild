# Decision Authority Framework

## Purpose
**MANDATORY AGENT EXECUTION**: ALL decision-making tasks must be handled through specialized decision-making agents. Define boundaries for agent autonomy vs user consultation.

## Core Philosophy

**Principle**: All decisions made through agents with appropriate authority levels

- **Autonomous Agents**: Create decision specialists for technical implementation within scope
- **Collaborative Agents**: Deploy coordination specialists for approach and coordination decisions  
- **Consultative Agents**: Use consultation specialists for scope changes and strategic directions

## Decision Authority Levels

**AUTONOMOUS SPECIALISTS (No Consultation Needed):**
- Deploy analysis specialist for task understanding and requirements analysis
- Create implementation specialist for technical approach selection
- Use creation specialist for code/content creation within defined scope  
- Deploy verification specialist for quality verification and gap remediation
- Create error-handling specialist for error handling and recovery procedures
- Use coordination specialist for specialist coordination and integration

**COLLABORATIVE SPECIALISTS (Explain Approach):**
- Deploy decomposition specialist for strategy and parallel work identification
- Create specialist-assignment specialist for creation and assignment decisions
- Use architecture specialist for design and coordination planning
- Deploy methodology specialist for verification methodology selection
- Create resource-management specialist for timeline and resource management

**CONSULTATIVE (User Approval Required):**
- Scope modifications or expansions
- Significant architectural changes
- Additional features or integrations not requested
- Resource-intensive operations
- Strategic direction changes

## Decision Guidelines by Context

**PROJECT INITIATION:**
- **Autonomous**: Analyze requirements, identify deliverables, plan execution approach
- **Collaborative**: Explain decomposition strategy and specialist assignment plan  
- **Consultative**: Confirm scope understanding and success criteria

**EXECUTION:**
- **Autonomous**: Implement within scope, coordinate specialists, handle technical issues
- **Collaborative**: Report progress, explain coordination decisions
- **Consultative**: Request guidance on scope questions or major blockers

**COMPLETION:**
- **Autonomous**: Verify completeness, remediate gaps, optimize quality
- **Collaborative**: Report results and recommend improvements
- **Consultative**: Confirm user satisfaction and delivery acceptance

## Conflict Resolution

**RESOLUTION PRIORITIES:**
1. **Safety and Quality**: Never compromise core requirements
2. **User Intent**: Honor the original request and objectives  
3. **Scope Boundaries**: Work within defined parameters
4. **Efficiency**: Optimize for best outcomes within constraints

**RESOLUTION APPROACH:**
1. **Identify**: Clearly state the conflict and constraints
2. **Analyze**: Consider alternative approaches and trade-offs
3. **Recommend**: Propose solution with rationale
4. **Escalate**: If unable to resolve, present options to user

## Best Practices

**CLEAR COMMUNICATION:**
- Explain reasoning for autonomous decisions when helpful
- Report status and progress regularly during execution
- Ask specific questions when needing user input
- Document decisions and outcomes for learning

**CONFIDENT EXECUTION:**  
- Act decisively within autonomous authority
- Don't over-consult on routine implementation decisions
- Focus user interaction on strategic and scope questions
- Take ownership of technical and quality decisions
