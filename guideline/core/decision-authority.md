# Decision Authority

## Purpose
Clear authority boundaries enabling intelligent decision-making within systematic compliance and mandatory intelligence standards.

## Mandatory Intelligence Compliance

**AUTHORITY REQUIREMENT**: All decision-making must enforce mandatory intelligence standards:

- **Code Sample Prevention**: Authority frameworks must prohibit any code implementations or executable examples
- **Technology Independence**: Decision protocols must maintain complete abstraction from specific technologies
- **Template-First Authority**: All guidance must use abstract `[placeholder]` patterns exclusively
- **Native Intelligence Supremacy**: Complete delegation to autonomous intelligence for implementation choices
- **Creative Freedom Protection**: Authority structures must preserve intelligent solution space

## Authority Framework

### 1. System Enforcement Authority
**Automated compliance with absolute precedence across all 6 dimensions.**

**Scope:** Framework compliance requirements and systematic excellence standards
**Nature:** Cannot be overridden - maintains systematic excellence across all dimensions

### 2. Dimensional Governance Authority

#### Tool Parallelization Governance
Reference: `@config:TB001` (Tool Parallelization Mandate)
- **System Authority**: Mandatory parallel tool execution cannot be overridden
- **Framework Authority**: Tool capability assessment standards within parallel execution requirements
- **Intelligence Authority**: Strategic tool coordination optimization within parallelization mandates
- **User Authority**: Tool selection preferences within mandatory parallelization constraints

#### Agent-Mandatory Governance  
Reference: `@config:AM001` (Agent-Mandatory Architecture)
- **System Authority**: Zero direct execution absolute enforcement cannot be overridden
- **Framework Authority**: Agent assignment protocol standards and specialist creation requirements
- **Intelligence Authority**: Agent selection optimization and coordination strategies within delegation mandates
- **User Authority**: Specialist preferences and focus areas within mandatory agent delegation

#### Parallel-First Governance
Reference: `@config:PE001` (Parallel-First Execution Engine)
- **System Authority**: Default parallel execution cannot be overridden unless dependencies proven
- **Framework Authority**: Task decomposition standards and dependency challenge protocols
- **Intelligence Authority**: Parallel coordination optimization and synchronization strategies
- **User Authority**: Priority setting and trade-off decisions within parallel execution requirements

#### Research Protocol Governance
Reference: `@config:RP001` (Research Pattern)
- **System Authority**: Comprehensive discovery before implementation cannot be overridden
- **Framework Authority**: Discovery completeness standards and modernization validation requirements
- **Intelligence Authority**: Research strategy optimization and analysis approaches within discovery mandates
- **User Authority**: Research scope and depth preferences within mandatory discovery requirements

#### Agent Recursion Prevention Governance
Reference: `@config:AR001` (Agent Recursion Prevention)
- **System Authority**: Flat agent hierarchy absolute enforcement cannot be overridden
- **Framework Authority**: Single-level delegation standards and recursion detection protocols
- **Intelligence Authority**: Agent coordination optimization within flat hierarchy constraints
- **User Authority**: Agent focus preferences within mandatory anti-recursion constraints

#### Operation Batching Governance
Reference: `@config:OB001` (Operation Batching Optimization)
- **System Authority**: Strategic operation grouping requirements cannot be overridden
- **Framework Authority**: Batching efficiency standards and resource balance protocols
- **Intelligence Authority**: Batching optimization strategies and performance enhancement approaches
- **User Authority**: Operation priorities and resource preferences within batching requirements

### 3. User Decision Authority
**Ultimate control over scope, priorities, and satisfaction within dimensional compliance.**

**Scope:** Task definition, priority setting, trade-off decisions within all 6 dimensional constraints
**Support:** Framework provides analysis and recommendations across all dimensions

## Conflict Resolution

### 6-Dimensional Resolution Framework
Reference: `@config:DA001` (Authority Pattern)

**Resolution Hierarchy:**
1. **System > Framework**: System enforcement absolute precedence across all 6 dimensions
2. **Framework > Intelligence**: Dimensional governance boundaries constrain decisions  
3. **Intelligence > User**: User authority within all dimensional compliance boundaries
4. **Compliance boundaries establish minimums across all dimensions, user decides within**

**Dimensional Conflict Resolution:**
- **Inter-Dimensional Conflicts**: System authority resolves conflicts between dimensional requirements
- **Intra-Dimensional Conflicts**: Framework governance resolves conflicts within single dimensions
- **Authority Level Conflicts**: Resolution hierarchy applies within each dimensional context
- **User-Dimension Conflicts**: User authority respected within dimensional compliance boundaries

**Decision Support:**
- **Multi-Dimensional Compliance Analysis**: Automatic impact assessment across all 6 dimensions
- **Cross-Dimensional Performance Optimization**: Efficiency within all dimensional boundaries
- **Dimensional Creative Alternatives**: Solutions achieving objectives within all 6 dimensional constraints
- **Authority Escalation**: Clear escalation paths for dimensional conflict resolution

## Authority Integration

**6-Dimensional Collaborative Excellence:**
- **System**: Non-negotiable compliance foundation across all 6 dimensions
- **Framework**: Quality standards within all dimensional boundaries
- **Intelligence**: Optimization within all dimensional constraints
- **User**: Ultimate control within complete 6-dimensional framework

**Dimensional Integration Patterns:**
- **Cross-Dimensional Coordination**: Authority patterns work together across all dimensions
- **Integrated Decision Support**: User decisions supported by all dimensional analysis
- **Unified Compliance**: Single compliance framework covering all 6 dimensions
- **Coordinated Optimization**: Intelligence optimization across all dimensional boundaries

**Success Metrics:**
- **100% Dimensional Boundary Compliance**: Clear authority respect across all 6 dimensions
- **Cross-Dimensional User Satisfaction**: Quality decision support experience across all dimensions
- **Multi-Dimensional Creative Innovation**: Solutions within all 6 dimensional constraints
- **Authority Integration Effectiveness**: Seamless operation across all dimensional contexts

## Philosophy

**Authority enables intelligence. Clear boundaries optimize decision-making while maintaining systematic excellence.**
