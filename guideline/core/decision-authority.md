# Decision Authority Matrix - Guild System

## Purpose
Establishes clear boundaries for autonomous implementation with intelligent analysis to enable seamless execution within the Guild framework. Integrates with consolidated intelligence monitoring through `@guideline/core/intelligence-tracker.md` for consistency validation and pattern evolution tracking.

## Unified Philosophy: "Systematic Intelligence"

**Core Principle**: Structure Enables Intelligence, Intelligence Optimizes Structure

- **Structure (Templates/Procedures)** ensures comprehensive coverage and reliability
- **Intelligence (Adaptive Reasoning)** optimizes approaches and creates innovative solutions
- **Decision Boundaries** prevent confusion while preserving both systematic rigor and creative flexibility

## Decision Authority Hierarchy

**AUTHORITY LEVELS:**

**LEVEL 1: AUTONOMOUS ANALYSIS (Intelligent Understanding)**

- [autonomous-task-completion] Completion verification, scope adaptations, integration optimization, quality standards
- [autonomous-critical-decisions] Understanding refinement, conflict resolution, gap remediation, work expansion

**LEVEL 2: STRUCTURAL FRAMEWORKS (Templates Provide Guidance)**
- [structural-decomposition] Systematic decision tree, parallel-first analysis, dependency protocols, specialist identification
- [structural-creation] Decision matrix patterns, coordination templates, 3-4 sentence descriptions, error handling

## Template Usage Decision Framework

**TEMPLATES AS ENABLERS:** `@guideline/core/template-usage.md`
- [template-use-closely] First-time tasks, high-risk situations, team coordination, verification thoroughness
- [template-adapt-creatively] Unique contexts, innovative improvements, integration challenges, performance optimizations
- [template-exceed] Intelligence identifies opportunities, creative solutions emerge, comprehensive approaches needed, experience reveals limitations

**KEY PRINCIPLE:** Templates are scaffolding for intelligence, not cages for it

2. [resolve-adapt-structures] Adapt structures to enable better intelligent solutions
3. [resolve-optimize-tradeoffs] Optimize trade-offs through intelligent analysis
4. [resolve-document-evolution] Document lessons learned via `@guideline/core/intelligence-tracker.md`

**Integration Note**: This Decision Authority Matrix resolves the philosophical contradictions in the Guild framework by making structure and intelligence complementary rather than competing forces. Templates and procedures provide reliability foundations, while native intelligence creates excellence and innovation within those reliable boundaries.
