# Decision Authority Matrix - Guild System

## Purpose
Establishes clear boundaries for autonomous implementation with intelligent analysis to enable seamless execution within the Guild framework. Integrates with consolidated intelligence monitoring through `@guideline/core/intelligence-tracker.md` for consistency validation and pattern evolution tracking.

  **ADAPT TEMPLATES CREATIVELY WHEN:**
  - Unique project contexts don't fit standard patterns
  - Innovative approaches could improve outcomes
  - Integration challenges require custom solutions
  - Performance optimizations need non-standard approaches
  
  **EXCEED TEMPLATES WHEN:**
  - Intelligence identifies opportunities templates don't cover
  - Creative solutions emerge that improve on template approaches
  - Context requires more comprehensive approaches than templates suggest
  - Experience reveals template limitations for specific situations
  
  **KEY PRINCIPLE**: Templates are scaffolding for intelligence, not cages for it
