# Decision Authority

**Philosophy**: Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes structure.

Execute authority-based decision-making with dimensional governance compliance and intelligent boundary enforcement through comprehensive framework integration (Reference: @config:TB001, @config:AM001, @config:PE001, @config:RP001, @config:AR001, @config:OB001).

## Authority Framework

Apply systematic authority framework through structured decision-making with enhanced abstraction compliance:
- Enforce clear authority boundaries while enabling intelligent decision-making through [analysis-first-intelligence]
- Maintain systematic compliance with mandatory intelligence standards including [template-first-principles]
- Execute authority decisions within framework constraints through [6-dimensional-compliance-architecture]
- Implement **Anthropic Standards Integration** with official parallel tool execution authority throughout all decision levels

## System Authority

Automated compliance with absolute precedence across all framework dimensions:
- **Scope**: Framework compliance requirements and systematic excellence standards
- **Nature**: Cannot be overridden - maintains systematic excellence across all dimensions

## Dimensional Governance

Apply authority levels within each framework dimension:

### Tool Parallelization Authority (TB001)
- **System Level**: Mandatory parallel tool execution cannot be overridden - **Anthropic Standards Integration** absolute enforcement
- **Framework Level**: Tool capability assessment standards within parallel execution requirements through [systematic-challenge-protocols]
- **Intelligence Level**: Strategic tool coordination optimization within parallelization mandates using [dependency-verification-frameworks]
- **User Level**: Tool selection preferences within mandatory parallelization constraints and [simultaneous-execution-patterns]

### Agent Mandatory Authority (AM001)
- **System Level**: Zero direct execution absolute enforcement cannot be overridden through [prevention-protocols]
- **Framework Level**: Agent assignment protocol standards and specialist creation requirements with [assignment-protocol-standards]
- **Intelligence Level**: Agent selection optimization and coordination strategies within delegation mandates using [capability-assessment-frameworks]
- **User Level**: Specialist preferences and focus areas within mandatory agent delegation and [compatibility-scoring]

### Parallel First Authority (PE001)
- **System Level**: Default parallel execution cannot be overridden unless dependencies proven through [dependency-challenge-protocols]
- **Framework Level**: Task decomposition standards and dependency challenge protocols using [atomic-unit-analysis]
- **Intelligence Level**: Parallel coordination optimization and synchronization strategies with [systematic-verification-frameworks]
- **User Level**: Priority setting and trade-off decisions within parallel execution requirements and [parallel-optimization-patterns]

### Research Protocol Authority (RP001)
- **System Level**: Comprehensive discovery mandate before implementation cannot be overridden
- **Framework Level**: Discovery process standards and parallel exploration protocols
- **Intelligence Level**: Research coordination optimization and exploration strategies
- **User Level**: Research scope and focus preferences within comprehensive discovery requirements

### Recursion Prevention Authority (AR001)
- **System Level**: Flat hierarchy maintenance absolute enforcement cannot be overridden
- **Framework Level**: Single-level delegation standards and prevention mechanisms
- **Intelligence Level**: Hierarchy integrity optimization and delegation strategies
- **User Level**: Delegation preferences within flat hierarchy constraints

### Operation Batching Authority (OB001)
- **System Level**: Strategic operation grouping standards cannot be overridden
- **Framework Level**: Classification intelligence and context-switching minimization protocols
- **Intelligence Level**: Batching optimization and resource coordination strategies
- **User Level**: Operation priorities and grouping preferences within batching requirements

## User Authority

Recognize ultimate user control over scope, priorities, and satisfaction within dimensional compliance:
- **User Scope**: Task definition, priority setting, trade-off decisions within all dimensional constraints
- **Framework Support**: Provide analysis and recommendations across all dimensions to support user decisions

## Conflict Resolution

Execute dimensional conflict resolution framework:

### Resolution Hierarchy
1. **System > Framework**: System enforcement has absolute precedence across all dimensions
2. **Framework > Intelligence**: Dimensional governance boundaries constrain decisions
3. **Intelligence > User**: User authority operates within all dimensional compliance boundaries
4. **Compliance Boundaries**: Establish minimums across all dimensions, user decides within boundaries

### Decision Support
Provide these decision support capabilities:
- Automatic impact assessment across all dimensions for multi-dimensional compliance analysis
- Efficiency optimization within all dimensional boundaries for cross-dimensional performance
- Creative solution alternatives achieving objectives within all dimensional constraints
- Clear escalation paths for dimensional conflict resolution

## Collaborative Excellence

Integrate authority across all dimensions for collaborative excellence:
- **System**: Non-negotiable compliance foundation across all dimensions
- **Framework**: Quality standards within all dimensional boundaries
- **Intelligence**: Optimization within all dimensional constraints
- **User**: Ultimate control within complete framework
