# Decision Authority

## Purpose
Clear authority boundaries enabling intelligent decision-making within systematic compliance and mandatory intelligence standards.

## Mandatory Intelligence Compliance

**AUTHORITY REQUIREMENT**: All decision-making must enforce mandatory intelligence standards:

- **Code Sample Prevention**: Authority frameworks must prohibit any code implementations or executable examples
- **Technology Independence**: Decision protocols must maintain complete abstraction from specific technologies
- **Template-First Authority**: All guidance must use abstract `[placeholder]` patterns exclusively
- **Native Intelligence Supremacy**: Complete delegation to autonomous intelligence for implementation choices
- **Creative Freedom Protection**: Authority structures must preserve intelligent solution space

## Authority Framework

### 1. System Enforcement Authority
**Automated compliance with absolute precedence.**

**Scope:** Framework compliance requirements and systematic excellence standards
**Nature:** Cannot be overridden - maintains systematic excellence

### 2. Framework Governance Authority  
**Quality standards and compliance validation.**

**Scope:** Quality verification, coverage requirements, compliance monitoring
**Flexibility:** Approach variation within compliance boundaries

### 3. Intelligence Coordination Authority
**Strategic optimization and performance enhancement.**

**Scope:** Agent selection, coordination strategies, performance optimization
**Creative Freedom:** Innovation encouraged within framework constraints

### 4. User Decision Authority
**Ultimate control over scope, priorities, and satisfaction.**

**Scope:** Task definition, priority setting, trade-off decisions
**Support:** Framework provides analysis and recommendations

## Conflict Resolution

### Resolution Framework
Reference: `@config:DA001`

**Resolution Hierarchy:**
1. **System > Framework**: System enforcement absolute precedence
2. **Framework > Intelligence**: Governance boundaries constrain decisions  
3. **Intelligence > User**: User authority within compliance boundaries
4. **Compliance boundaries establish minimums, user decides within**

**Decision Support:**
- **Compliance Analysis**: Automatic impact assessment
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficiency within boundaries
- **Creative Alternatives**: Solutions achieving objectives within constraints

## Authority Integration

**Collaborative Excellence:**
- **System**: Non-negotiable compliance foundation
- **Framework**: Quality standards within boundaries
- **Intelligence**: Optimization within constraints
- **User**: Ultimate control within framework

**Success Metrics:**
- **100% Boundary Compliance**: Clear authority respect
- **User Satisfaction**: Quality decision support experience
- **Creative Innovation**: Solutions within constraints

## Philosophy

**Authority enables intelligence. Clear boundaries optimize decision-making while maintaining systematic excellence.**
