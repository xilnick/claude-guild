# Core Intelligence Modules

Streamlined modules that guide Claude's native intelligence for task execution without redundancy.

## Module Hierarchy

### Primary Execution Modules

**workflow.md** - Core execution patterns
- Native intelligence routing and parallel execution
- Systematic decomposition with autonomous iteration
- Integration with specialist creation and verification

**agents.md** - Subagent creation and management
- Enhanced persistent vs dynamic decision framework  
- Intelligent pattern matching for existing agents
- Proactive parallel specialist creation strategies

**verification.md** - Quality assurance patterns
- Parallel verification methodology
- Autonomous gap detection and remediation
- Integration testing and quality standards

### Authority and Adaptation Modules

**decision-authority.md** - Authority boundaries
- 4-level decision hierarchy (Autonomous → Structural → Implementation → Advisory)
- Clear confirmation vs autonomous execution boundaries
- Conflict resolution and escalation protocols

**template-usage.md** - Template adaptation guidelines
- Templates as intelligence enablers, not constraints
- Progressive enhancement methodology
- Creative adaptation within structural safety

**intelligence-boundaries.md** - Structure vs autonomy framework
- Complementary intelligence layer operation
- Collaborative decision zones and boundary management
- Structure-intelligence integration protocols

## Consolidation Benefits

**ELIMINATED REDUNDANCY:**
- Removed unified-principles.md (85% overlap with other modules)
- Removed user-adoption-analytics.md (excessive complexity overkill)
- Eliminated circular cross-references creating dependency loops

**ENHANCED FOCUS:**
- Clear module hierarchy without overlap
- Focused intelligence tracking without philosophical redundancy
- Streamlined cross-references for better maintainability

**IMPROVED SUBAGENT INVOCATION:**
- Enhanced persistent agent discovery and pattern matching
- Clear dynamic vs persistent decision framework
- Better integration with existing agent ecosystem

## Core Philosophy

Systematic Intelligence: Structure enables intelligence, intelligence optimizes structure. These modules provide reliability foundations while enabling creative excellence through complementary operation rather than competing approaches.

**Implementation Standards**: All modules follow Tool Use Implementation requirements with 4-5 sentence specialist descriptions, comprehensive error handling, and parallel execution optimization.
