# Core Intelligence Modules

Simple modules that guide Claude's native intelligence for task execution.

## Modules

### workflow.md
Natural task orchestration using Claude's native abilities to decompose and coordinate work.

### agents.md  
Dynamic specialist creation based on actual task needs, not templates.

### verification.md
Simple verification using natural success criteria and quality checks.

## Philosophy

These modules provide light guidance while trusting Claude's native intelligence to:
- Analyze tasks naturally
- Create appropriate specialists dynamically
- Coordinate execution based on dependencies
- Verify work quality

**Tool Use Implementation**: All modules follow Anthropic's Tool Use Implementation standards, requiring 3-4 sentence descriptions for specialists, comprehensive error handling, and parallel execution optimization for Claude 4.

No rigid frameworks, templates, or complex orchestration needed.
