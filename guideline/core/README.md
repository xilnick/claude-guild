# Core Intelligence Modules

**Elegant, principle-focused modules delivering comprehensive Guild system intelligence.**

## Module Architecture

### Core Framework Modules

**shared-configs.md** - Essential patterns and configurations
- Core @config reference system for consistent integration
- Essential coordination patterns eliminating redundancy
- Resource types, coordination strategies, and recovery patterns
- Simplified pattern library enabling intelligent execution

**decision-authority.md** - Authority boundaries enabling intelligence
- 4-level hierarchy with clear precedence
- Automated boundary enforcement with decision support
- Conflict resolution with creative alternatives
- User authority protection within framework constraints

**verification.md** - Intelligence-driven verification
- Multi-domain coordination across functional and compliance dimensions
- Parallel verification with intelligent integration
- Quality gates with framework compliance validation
- Continuous optimization with performance monitoring

## Framework Benefits

**Elegant Simplicity:**
- Clean, focused modules without redundancy
- Essential patterns enabling rather than constraining intelligence
- Consistent philosophy across all components
- Streamlined configuration with clear references

**Intelligent Coordination:**
- Structure enables rather than restricts creativity
- Cross-module synergy optimizes execution
- Unified approach across all framework dimensions
- Performance optimization through systematic intelligence

## Core Philosophy

**Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes structure.**

Framework provides systematic foundation while enabling creative solutions within compliance boundaries.

## Success Metrics

- **Excellence Standards** across all framework dimensions
- **High Performance** with user satisfaction
- **Elegant execution** through intelligent coordination
