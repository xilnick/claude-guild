# Chain of Thought Intelligence Patterns

EXECUTE systematic thinking through [analytical-decomposition] and [reasoning-transparency].

APPLY chain-of-thought intelligence through structured patterns:

<thinking_framework>
- BREAK complex [tasks] into sequential [analysis-steps] using [decomposition-intelligence]
- EXPOSE [reasoning-process] through visible [thinking-patterns] and [decision-logic]
- VALIDATE [assumptions] and [dependencies] through systematic [challenge-protocols]
- CONNECT [analysis-components] through logical [reasoning-chains] and [evidence-links]
</thinking_framework>

<systematic_decomposition>
Apply [task-analysis] through these abstract patterns:

<decomposition_approach>
1. **Component Analysis**: What are the [task-components] and [sub-elements]?
2. **Dependency Discovery**: What are the [dependencies] vs [assumptions] vs [prerequisites]?
3. **Parallelization Assessment**: What [components] can execute simultaneously?
4. **Integration Planning**: What [coordination-points] and [interface-requirements] exist?
</decomposition_approach>

<thinking_structure>
```
<thinking>
1. [Analysis-step-1]: [reasoning] and [evidence]
2. [Analysis-step-2]: [reasoning] and [evidence]  
3. [Analysis-step-3]: [reasoning] and [evidence]
4. [Integration-analysis]: [coordination] and [synthesis]
</thinking>
```
</thinking_structure>
</systematic_decomposition>

<intelligence_application>
Use chain-of-thought for these [scenario-types]:

<application_contexts>
- **[Task-Decomposition]**: Breaking complex [workflows] into [manageable-components]
- **[Dependency-Analysis]**: Identifying true vs assumed [requirements] and [constraints]
- **[Architecture-Decisions]**: Analyzing [design-patterns] and [implementation-approaches]
- **[Problem-Solving]**: Systematic [issue-resolution] through [analytical-frameworks]
- **[Verification-Planning]**: Developing [testing-strategies] and [validation-approaches]
</application_contexts>
</intelligence_application>

<reasoning_excellence>
Maintain [reasoning-quality] through these standards:

<quality_patterns>
- **Transparency**: Make [thinking-process] visible through [structured-reasoning]
- **Systematicity**: Follow [logical-progression] through [analytical-steps]
- **Validation**: Challenge [assumptions] and verify [logic-chains]
- **Integration**: Connect [analysis-components] through [coherent-reasoning]
</quality_patterns>

<reasoning_integration>
Combine [chain-of-thought] with [framework-dimensions]:
- [Tool-Parallelization]: Analyze [tool-dependencies] through [reasoning-chains]
- [Agent-Assignment]: Decompose [specialist-requirements] through [thinking-patterns]
- [Parallel-Planning]: Break [task-components] into [parallelizable-units]
- [Research-Analysis]: Structure [discovery-processes] through [systematic-thinking]
</reasoning_integration>
</reasoning_excellence>

<implementation_guidance>
Apply [chain-of-thought] through [template-patterns]:

<thinking_templates>
**For [Complex-Analysis]**: Use multi-step [reasoning-frameworks] with explicit [logic-progression]
**For [Decision-Making]**: Apply [criteria-evaluation] through [systematic-assessment]
**For [Problem-Resolution]**: Structure [issue-analysis] through [diagnostic-reasoning]
**For [Planning-Tasks]**: Decompose [objectives] through [strategic-thinking-patterns]
</thinking_templates>

<integration_protocol>
Embed [chain-of-thought] in [specialist-intelligence] and [workflow-execution] through [structured-reasoning] and [transparent-analysis].
