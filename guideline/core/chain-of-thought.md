# Chain of Thought Intelligence Patterns

**Philosophy**: Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes structure.

EXECUTE systematic thinking through [analytical-decomposition] and [reasoning-transparency] with enhanced dimensional coordination patterns (Reference: @config:TB001, @config:AM001, @config:PE001, @config:RP001, @config:AR001, @config:OB001).

APPLY chain-of-thought intelligence through structured patterns with simultaneous tool execution analysis:

<thinking_framework>
- BREAK complex [tasks] into [parallel-analytical-components] using [decomposition-intelligence] and [parallelization-assessment]
- EXPOSE [reasoning-process] through visible [thinking-patterns] and [decision-logic] with [tool-coordination-analysis]
- VALIDATE [assumptions] and [dependencies] through systematic [challenge-protocols] and [atomic-unit-verification]
- CONNECT [analysis-components] through logical [reasoning-chains] and [evidence-links] with [cross-dimensional-integration]
</thinking_framework>

<systematic_decomposition>
Apply [task-analysis] through these abstract patterns:

<decomposition_approach>
1. **Component Analysis**: What are the [task-components] and [sub-elements] that can operate through [specialist-assignment]?
2. **Dependency Discovery**: What are the [dependencies] vs [assumptions] vs [prerequisites] requiring [systematic-challenge-protocols]?
3. **Parallelization Assessment**: What [components] can execute simultaneously through [atomic-unit-analysis] and [tool-coordination]?
4. **Integration Planning**: What [coordination-points] and [interface-requirements] exist for [cross-dimensional-workflows]?
5. **Tool Operation Analysis**: What [tool-dependencies] exist vs [assumed-sequential-patterns] through [systematic-verification-frameworks]?
</decomposition_approach>

<thinking_structure>
```
<thinking>
1. [Analysis-step-1]: [reasoning] and [evidence]
2. [Analysis-step-2]: [reasoning] and [evidence]  
3. [Analysis-step-3]: [reasoning] and [evidence]
4. [Integration-analysis]: [coordination] and [synthesis]
</thinking>
```
</thinking_structure>
</systematic_decomposition>

<intelligence_application>
Use chain-of-thought for these [scenario-types]:

<application_contexts>
- **[Task-Decomposition]**: Breaking complex [workflows] into [manageable-components]
- **[Dependency-Analysis]**: Identifying true vs assumed [requirements] and [constraints]
- **[Architecture-Decisions]**: Analyzing [design-patterns] and [implementation-approaches]
- **[Problem-Solving]**: Systematic [issue-resolution] through [analytical-frameworks]
- **[Verification-Planning]**: Developing [testing-strategies] and [validation-approaches]
</application_contexts>
</intelligence_application>

<reasoning_excellence>
Maintain [reasoning-quality] through these standards:

<quality_patterns>
- **Transparency**: Make [thinking-process] visible through [structured-reasoning]
- **Systematicity**: Follow [logical-progression] through [analytical-steps]
- **Validation**: Challenge [assumptions] and verify [logic-chains]
- **Integration**: Connect [analysis-components] through [coherent-reasoning]
</quality_patterns>

<reasoning_integration>
Combine [chain-of-thought] with [framework-dimensions] through enhanced coordination patterns:
- **TB001 Integration**: Analyze [tool-dependencies] through [reasoning-chains] with [simultaneous-execution-assessment]
- **AM001 Integration**: Decompose [specialist-requirements] through [thinking-patterns] with [assignment-protocol-standards]
- **PE001 Integration**: Break [task-components] into [parallelizable-units] through [atomic-unit-analysis] and [dependency-challenge-protocols]
- **RP001 Integration**: Structure [discovery-processes] through [systematic-thinking] with [parallel-exploration-frameworks]
- **AR001 Integration**: Maintain [flat-hierarchy-analysis] through [prevention-mechanism-reasoning]
- **OB001 Integration**: Apply [operation-classification-intelligence] through [batching-optimization-analysis]

**Cross-Dimensional Workflow Integration**:
- **Discovery-Assignment-Execution**: RP001 → AM001 → PE001 coordination through [reasoning-chain-pipelines]
- **Parallel-Tool-Batching**: TB001 ↔ OB001 integration through [simultaneous-reasoning-patterns]
- **Assignment-Hierarchy-Control**: AM001 ↔ AR001 coordination through [flat-delegation-analysis]
</reasoning_integration>
</reasoning_excellence>

<implementation_guidance>
Apply [chain-of-thought] through [template-patterns]:

<thinking_templates>
**For [Complex-Analysis]**: Use multi-step [reasoning-frameworks] with explicit [logic-progression]
**For [Decision-Making]**: Apply [criteria-evaluation] through [systematic-assessment]
**For [Problem-Resolution]**: Structure [issue-analysis] through [diagnostic-reasoning]
**For [Planning-Tasks]**: Decompose [objectives] through [strategic-thinking-patterns]
</thinking_templates>

<integration_protocol>
Embed [chain-of-thought] in [specialist-intelligence] and [workflow-execution] through [structured-reasoning] and [transparent-analysis].
