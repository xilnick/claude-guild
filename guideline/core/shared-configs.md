# Shared Configurations

**Philosophy**: Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes structure.

Apply core intelligence patterns through systematic coordination with mandatory abstraction compliance and comprehensive dimensional integration (Reference: @config:TB001, @config:AM001, @config:PE001, @config:RP001, @config:AR001, @config:OB001).

## Core Intelligence Patterns

Execute pattern-based intelligence coordination with enhanced framework alignment:
- Apply essential patterns for systematic intelligence coordination with mandatory abstraction standards and [template-first-principles]
- Enforce abstraction compliance through placeholder pattern utilization and [technology-independence-verification]
- Coordinate intelligent systems through standardized pattern execution with [6-dimensional-compliance-architecture]
- Maintain systematic excellence through pattern-driven coordination and [analysis-first-intelligence]
- Implement **Anthropic Standards Integration** through official parallel tool execution patterns across all configuration templates

## Framework Configuration Patterns

### Agent Creation Pattern (@config:AG001)
**Principle**: Intelligent specialist discovery and deployment
- **Discovery**: Assess existing capabilities before creation
- **Creation**: Focused, minimal specialist descriptions
- **Integration**: Parallel coordination planning

### Agent Mandatory Pattern (@config:AM001)
**Principle**: Zero direct execution with mandatory agent delegation and enhanced protocol standards
- **Assignment Protocol Standards**: Route every task through [specialist-assignment-evaluation] with [task-analysis], [capability-assessment], [direct-execution-prevention], and [assignment-verification]
- **Task Analysis**: Evaluate [task-complexity] and [domain-requirements] for optimal specialist selection
- **Capability Assessment**: Match [task-characteristics] with [specialist-expertise] through systematic evaluation
- **Direct Prevention**: Block inappropriate direct execution through [automated-guard-mechanisms] and [prevention-protocols]
- **Assignment Verification**: Confirm specialist selection through [compatibility-scoring] and [effectiveness-metrics]
- **Implementation Requirements**: Mandatory specialist assignment for all [work-categories] without exception through [systematic-specialist-development]
- **Monitoring**: Track compliance with delegation standards and assignment protocols through [verification-streams] and [quality-gates]

### Execution Pattern (@config:EX001)
**Principle**: Systematic decomposition with parallel optimization
- **Decomposition**: Break tasks into independent units
- **Challenge**: Question sequential assumptions systematically
- **Coordination**: Minimize overhead while maximizing parallelism
- **Excellence**: Achieve high performance across all dimensions

### Parallel First Pattern (@config:PE001)
**Principle**: Default parallel task decomposition with enhanced dependency challenge protocols
- **Atomic Unit Analysis**: Decompose [complex-tasks] into smallest parallelizable [work-units] through systematic breakdown
- **Sequential Assumption Challenge**: Question all assumed dependencies through [dependency-verification-frameworks]
- **True Dependency Identification**: Distinguish actual dependencies from assumed sequential patterns using [analysis-protocols]
- **Parallel Optimization**: Default to simultaneous execution unless [proven-dependencies] require sequential processing
- **Implementation Requirements**: Systematic task decomposition into [atomic-parallel-components] before execution begins
- **Dependency Challenge Protocols**: Mandatory dependency challenge through [assumption-verification] protocols for all sequential requirements
- **Parallel Execution Planning**: Explicit [integration-points] and [synchronization-patterns] with [parallel-coordination] and [efficiency-tracking] mechanisms
- **Synchronization Design**: Plan integration points before parallel execution begins with [performance-optimization] tracking

### Research Pattern (@config:RP001)
**Principle**: Comprehensive discovery before implementation
- **Discovery**: Execute parallel analysis of structure, technology, and impact
- **Modernization**: Validate current standards and best practices
- **Validation**: Complete affected area mapping systematically

### Tool Parallelization Pattern (@config:TB001)
**Principle**: Mandatory parallel tool execution with **Anthropic Standards Integration** and capability-aware optimization
- **Anthropic Standards Enforcement**: All specialists must implement official parallel tool execution with the mandate: "For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially."
- **Implementation Requirements**: Batch independent tool operations in single responses with default simultaneous execution for file operations, analysis tasks, and discovery processes
- **Dependency Verification**: Question sequential assumptions through systematic dependency verification with [systematic-challenge-protocols]
- **Performance Measurement**: Measure and optimize parallelization effectiveness continuously with [measurable-performance-improvements]
- **Parallel Discovery**: Execute simultaneous tool capability scanning and parallel inventory assessment
- **Parallelization Profiling**: Assess tool parallel execution characteristics and concurrent optimization potential
- **Parallel Batching**: Group tool-aware operations for simultaneous execution and maximum efficiency through [context-switching-minimization]
- **Parallel Optimization**: Monitor continuous parallel tool utilization and concurrent performance improvement with [efficiency-tracking-mechanisms]

### Agent Recursion Prevention Pattern (@config:AR001)
**Principle**: Mandatory flat agent hierarchy with anti-recursion enforcement
- **Hierarchy Constraint**: Only primary system creates and invokes agents
- **Recursion Detection**: Execute runtime monitoring and blocking of subagent creation attempts
- **Delegation Authority**: Maintain single-level delegation through primary system exclusively
- **Resource Protection**: Prevent infinite recursion and resource exhaustion

### Operation Batching Pattern (@config:OB001)
**Principle**: Strategic operation grouping for enhanced performance
- **Operation Classification**: Group operations by type, resource usage, and interdependencies
- **Performance Enhancement**: Minimize context switching through strategic operation grouping
- **Resource Balance**: Coordinate parallel execution with system resource constraints
- **Efficiency Tracking**: Execute real-time performance monitoring with systematic optimization

## Resource Management Patterns

### Resource Classification (@config:RT001)
**Principle**: Optimal resource allocation by complexity
- **Immediate**: Discovery, validation, planning tasks
- **Moderate**: Transformation, knowledge, interaction tasks
- **Intensive**: Deep analysis, comprehensive examination tasks

### Coordination Strategy (@config:CS001)
**Principle**: Parallel-first execution with systematic oversight
- **Parallel-First**: Execute mandatory simultaneous operations unless proven dependencies exist
- **Tool Parallelization**: Coordinate simultaneous tools for maximum efficiency
- **Strategic**: Monitor parallel coordination for complex multi-tool interactions
- **Sequential**: Reserve only for proven sequential dependencies after verification
- **Efficiency**: Maximize parallel coordination with optimized resource utilization

### Recovery Strategy (@config:RP002)
**Principle**: Adaptive resilience with systematic alternatives
- **Resource Issues**: Apply fallback chains with manual alternatives
- **Coordination Conflicts**: Execute dynamic reallocation and resolution
