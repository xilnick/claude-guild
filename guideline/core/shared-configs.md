# Shared Configurations

Apply core intelligence patterns through systematic coordination with mandatory abstraction compliance.

## Core Intelligence Patterns

Execute pattern-based intelligence coordination:
- Apply essential patterns for systematic intelligence coordination with mandatory abstraction standards
- Enforce abstraction compliance through placeholder pattern utilization
- Coordinate intelligent systems through standardized pattern execution
- Maintain systematic excellence through pattern-driven coordination

## Framework Configuration Patterns

### Agent Creation Pattern (@config:AG001)
**Principle**: Intelligent specialist discovery and deployment
- **Discovery**: Assess existing capabilities before creation
- **Creation**: Focused, minimal specialist descriptions
- **Integration**: Parallel coordination planning

### Agent Mandatory Pattern (@config:AM001)
**Principle**: Zero direct execution with mandatory agent delegation
- **Assignment Protocol**: Route every task through specialist assignment evaluation
- **Direct Prevention**: Block inappropriate direct execution through automated guards
- **Agent Creation**: Use standardized specialist development with capability assessment
- **Monitoring**: Track compliance with delegation standards and assignment protocols

### Execution Pattern (@config:EX001)
**Principle**: Systematic decomposition with parallel optimization
- **Decomposition**: Break tasks into independent units
- **Challenge**: Question sequential assumptions systematically
- **Coordination**: Minimize overhead while maximizing parallelism
- **Excellence**: Achieve high performance across all dimensions

### Parallel First Pattern (@config:PE001)
**Principle**: Default parallel task decomposition with dependency challenge
- **Task Analysis**: Break tasks into atomic parallelizable units
- **Dependency Discovery**: Identify true vs. assumed dependencies with challenge protocols
- **Parallel Default**: Execute simultaneously unless proven dependencies exist
- **Synchronization Design**: Plan integration points before parallel execution begins

### Research Pattern (@config:RP001)
**Principle**: Comprehensive discovery before implementation
- **Discovery**: Execute parallel analysis of structure, technology, and impact
- **Modernization**: Validate current standards and best practices
- **Validation**: Complete affected area mapping systematically

### Tool Parallelization Pattern (@config:TB001)
**Principle**: Mandatory parallel tool execution with capability-aware optimization
- **Parallel Discovery**: Execute simultaneous tool capability scanning and parallel inventory assessment
- **Parallelization Profiling**: Assess tool parallel execution characteristics and concurrent optimization potential
- **Parallel Batching**: Group tool-aware operations for simultaneous execution and maximum efficiency
- **Parallel Optimization**: Monitor continuous parallel tool utilization and concurrent performance improvement

### Agent Recursion Prevention Pattern (@config:AR001)
**Principle**: Mandatory flat agent hierarchy with anti-recursion enforcement
- **Hierarchy Constraint**: Only primary system creates and invokes agents
- **Recursion Detection**: Execute runtime monitoring and blocking of subagent creation attempts
- **Delegation Authority**: Maintain single-level delegation through primary system exclusively
- **Resource Protection**: Prevent infinite recursion and resource exhaustion

### Operation Batching Pattern (@config:OB001)
**Principle**: Strategic operation grouping for enhanced performance
- **Operation Classification**: Group operations by type, resource usage, and interdependencies
- **Performance Enhancement**: Minimize context switching through strategic operation grouping
- **Resource Balance**: Coordinate parallel execution with system resource constraints
- **Efficiency Tracking**: Execute real-time performance monitoring with systematic optimization

## Resource Management Patterns

### Resource Classification (@config:RT001)
**Principle**: Optimal resource allocation by complexity
- **Immediate**: Discovery, validation, planning tasks
- **Moderate**: Transformation, knowledge, interaction tasks
- **Intensive**: Deep analysis, comprehensive examination tasks

### Coordination Strategy (@config:CS001)
**Principle**: Parallel-first execution with systematic oversight
- **Parallel-First**: Execute mandatory simultaneous operations unless proven dependencies exist
- **Tool Parallelization**: Coordinate simultaneous tools for maximum efficiency
- **Strategic**: Monitor parallel coordination for complex multi-tool interactions
- **Sequential**: Reserve only for proven sequential dependencies after verification
- **Efficiency**: Maximize parallel coordination with optimized resource utilization

### Recovery Strategy (@config:RP002)
**Principle**: Adaptive resilience with systematic alternatives
- **Resource Issues**: Apply fallback chains with manual alternatives
- **Coordination Conflicts**: Execute dynamic reallocation and resolution
- **Performance Issues**: Implement automatic strategy adjustment
