# Template Usage Guidelines - Guild System

## Purpose
Clarifies when and how to use vs adapt templates, resolving the tension between "templates for consistency" and "creative problem-solving" in the Guild framework. Integrates with consolidated intelligence patterns from `@guideline/core/subagent-invocation.md` for agent template adaptation and `@guideline/core/intelligence-tracker.md` for template evolution monitoring.

## Core Philosophy: Templates as Intelligence Enablers

**Fundamental Principle**: Templates are scaffolding for intelligence, not cages for it.

- **Templates provide MINIMUM STANDARDS**, not maximum capabilities
- **Intelligence EXCEEDS template baselines**, not just follows them
- **Adaptation ENHANCES templates**, not abandons them
- **Evolution IMPROVES templates** through intelligent insights

## Template Usage Decision Framework

**USAGE SCENARIOS:**
- [scenario-follow-closely] First-time tasks, risk management, team consistency, quality assurance → Templates as comprehensive checklists
- [scenario-adapt-creatively] Unique contexts, performance optimization, integration challenges, innovation opportunities → Templates as foundation, enhance with adaptations  
- [scenario-exceed-templates] Intelligence identifies gaps, creative solutions emerge, experience improvements, context enhancements → Templates as starting point, intelligence creates excellence

## Template Adaptation Patterns

**PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT:**
1. [enhance-establish-baseline] Complete template coverage and baseline metrics
2. [enhance-analyze-context] Project requirements, constraints, opportunities
3. [enhance-design-intelligence] Adaptations, solutions, optimizations, integration
4. [enhance-validate-integrate] Meet requirements, test standards, document successes

**ADAPTATION CATEGORIES:**
- [adapt-structural] Organization, flow, checkpoints, coordination patterns
- [adapt-content] Domain requirements, quality criteria, verification techniques
- [adapt-process] Workflows, protocols, resource utilization, error handling
- [adapt-innovation] Best practices, tools, lessons learned, creative solutions

## Specialist Template Usage Guidelines

**AGENT SELECTION INTEGRATION:** `@guideline/core/subagent-invocation.md`
1. [specialist-execute-discovery] Discovery protocol for available persistent agents
2. [specialist-apply-scoring] Determine optimal agent type (persistent vs dynamic vs hybrid)
3. [specialist-adapt-context] Appropriate adaptation template based on scores
4. [specialist-customize] Template customization within selected framework

**AGENT TYPE TEMPLATES:**
- [template-persistent-85-100] Established templates + context adaptation + proven patterns
- [template-dynamic-under-55] 4-sentence standard + Tool Use compliance + creative starting points
- [template-hybrid-55-69] Combined templates + coordination patterns + integration bridges
- [template-verification] Consolidated verification intelligence + agent-aware templates

**CUSTOMIZATION LEVELS:**
- [customize-level-1] Parameters, thresholds, timelines, formats
- [customize-level-2] Workflows, specialized steps, coordination protocols
- [customize-level-3] Organization redesign, hybrid approaches, innovative methodologies

## Template Evolution Framework

**FEEDBACK INTEGRATION:** `@guideline/core/intelligence-tracker.md`
1. [evolve-document-adaptations] Record adaptations, outcomes, patterns, stakeholder feedback
2. [evolve-analyze-patterns] Common patterns, customization needs, effectiveness improvements
3. [evolve-design-enhancements] Template improvements, intelligence insights, specialized variations
4. [evolve-integrate-validate] Base template integration, pilot validation, broader adoption

**INNOVATION INTEGRATION:**
- [innovate-capture] Systematically capture innovative solutions during implementation
- [innovate-evaluate] Effectiveness, applicability, safety standards, clear value
- [innovate-implement] Preserve core value, optional enhancements, usage guidance, compatibility testing

## Quality Assurance for Template Usage

**STRUCTURED FLEXIBILITY:**
- [qa-minimum-standards] Template requirements, safety standards, coordination compatibility, documentation
- [qa-enhancement-validation] Baseline improvements, quality maintenance, effectiveness testing, pattern integration
- [qa-continuous-metrics] Effectiveness tracking, quality measurement, coordination monitoring, stakeholder assessment

## Implementation Guidelines

**PRACTICAL APPLICATION:**
- [implement-specialist-creation] Template foundation → context analysis → design enhancements → validate → document
- [implement-coordination] Baseline frameworks → adapt patterns → enhance protocols → optimize efficiency → share innovations
- [implement-verification] Comprehensive templates → intelligent techniques → adapt criteria → innovative methods → contribute improvements

## Success Criteria

**EFFECTIVENESS METRICS:**
- [success-baseline] Template requirements, safety standards, coordination compatibility, documentation
- [success-enhancement] Adaptation improvements, quality enhancements, measurable value, pattern integration
- [success-evolution] Template improvements, innovation patterns, intelligence integration, framework enhancement

**Integration Note**: These Template Usage Guidelines resolve the "templates vs creativity" tension by positioning templates as enablers of intelligence rather than constraints on it. Templates provide reliable foundations, intelligence creates excellence beyond those foundations.
