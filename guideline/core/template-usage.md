# Template Usage Guidelines - Guild System

## Purpose
Clarifies when and how to use vs adapt templates, resolving the tension between "templates for consistency" and "creative problem-solving" in the Guild framework. Integrates with consolidated intelligence patterns from `@guideline/core/subagent-invocation.md` for agent template adaptation and `@guideline/core/intelligence-tracker.md` for template evolution monitoring.

## Core Philosophy: Templates as Intelligence Enablers

**Fundamental Principle**: Templates are scaffolding for intelligence, not cages for it.

- **Templates provide MINIMUM STANDARDS**, not maximum capabilities
- **Intelligence EXCEEDS template baselines**, not just follows them
- **Adaptation ENHANCES templates**, not abandons them
- **Evolution IMPROVES templates** through intelligent insights
