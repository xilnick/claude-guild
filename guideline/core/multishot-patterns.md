# Multishot Patterns

**Philosophy**: Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes structure.

Execute pattern learning through example-driven intelligence and consistency frameworks with comprehensive dimensional integration (Reference: @config:TB001, @config:AM001, @config:PE001, @config:RP001, @config:AR001, @config:OB001).

## Example Framework

Apply multishot patterns through systematic example structures with enhanced abstraction compliance:
- Provide pattern examples for common task types and execution approaches using [template-first-principles]
- Structure examples using consistent template patterns and format standards with [placeholder-pattern-validation]
- Include edge cases and exception handling through example scenarios with [systematic-excellence-verification]
- Enable pattern recognition through systematic example organization with [6-dimensional-compliance-architecture]
- Implement **Anthropic Standards Integration** through examples demonstrating official parallel tool execution patterns

## Pattern Organization

Structure examples through these abstract patterns:

### Example Categories
- **Simple Patterns**: Basic task execution with [single-specialist-approaches] and [assignment-protocol-standards]
- **Complex Patterns**: Multi-component workflows with [parallel-coordination] and [cross-dimensional-workflows]
- **Integration Patterns**: Cross-domain coordination and interface management through [systematic-interdependency-patterns]
- **Error Patterns**: Exception handling and recovery approaches with [prevention-mechanisms]
- **Optimization Patterns**: Performance enhancement and efficiency strategies through [parallel-tool-execution] and [atomic-unit-analysis]
- **Tool Parallelization Patterns**: Examples of [simultaneous-execution-patterns] and [dependency-challenge-protocols]
- **Assignment Protocol Patterns**: Examples of [task-analysis], [capability-assessment], and [assignment-verification] workflows

## Pattern Application

Apply multishot intelligence through these usage contexts:

### Application Scenarios
- **Task Pattern Recognition**: Identify optimal execution approaches through pattern matching
- **Consistency Maintenance**: Ensure systematic approach standards across similar scenarios
- **Quality Assurance**: Reference proven patterns for reliability and predictability
- **Learning Acceleration**: Enable rapid pattern adoption through structured examples

### Framework Integration
Integrate multishot patterns with framework dimensions through enhanced coordination:
- **Tool Parallelization (TB001)**: Examples of simultaneous tool execution and dependency management with [Anthropic-standards-integration]
- **Agent Assignment (AM001)**: Patterns for specialist selection and delegation approaches through [assignment-protocol-standards]
- **Parallel Planning (PE001)**: Examples of task decomposition and coordination strategies with [atomic-unit-analysis] and [dependency-challenge-protocols]
- **Research Protocol (RP001)**: Patterns for comprehensive discovery and parallel exploration frameworks
- **Recursion Prevention (AR001)**: Examples of flat hierarchy maintenance and prevention mechanisms
- **Operation Batching (OB001)**: Patterns for strategic grouping and classification intelligence
- **Cross-Dimensional Workflows**: Examples demonstrating [Discovery-Assignment-Execution], [Parallel-Tool-Batching], and [Assignment-Hierarchy-Control] coordination
- **Verification**: Patterns for systematic validation and quality assessment through [multi-dimensional-compliance]

## Consistency Standards

Maintain pattern consistency through systematic approaches:

### Consistency Framework
- **Format Standardization**: Use consistent template structures across all example types
- **Terminology Alignment**: Apply standard placeholder patterns and abstract terms
- **Quality Validation**: Verify example effectiveness through pattern testing
- **Evolution Management**: Update patterns based on usage feedback and optimization discoveries

### Pattern Quality
Ensure example excellence through these standards with enhanced compliance:
- **Clarity**: Examples demonstrate clear execution patterns and expected outcomes through [analysis-first-intelligence]
- **Completeness**: Cover common scenarios, edge cases, and exception handling with [systematic-excellence-verification]
- **Abstraction**: Maintain complete technology independence through placeholder patterns with [template-first-validation]
- **Systematic**: Follow framework compliance across all dimensional requirements through [6-dimensional-compliance-architecture]
- **Tool Parallelization Excellence**: Examples must demonstrate simultaneous execution patterns and measurable performance improvements
- **Assignment Protocol Excellence**: Examples must include proper [task-analysis], [capability-assessment], and [assignment-verification] patterns
