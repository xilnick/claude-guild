# Guild System Framework

<core_philosophy>
**Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes structure.**

<principles>
- **Systematic Foundation**: Provides reliability and comprehensive coverage
- **Intelligent Optimization**: Enables excellence and creative solutions through parallel tool coordination
- **Unified Integration**: Combines both for superior outcomes with simultaneous operation execution
- **Continuous Evolution**: Improves systems based on insights and parallelization performance metrics
- **Tool Coordination Excellence**: Maximizes efficiency through Anthropic's parallel execution standards
</principles>
</core_philosophy>

<compliance_architecture>

<foundational_requirements>
**Intelligence Abstraction Compliance:**
- **Absolute Code Prohibition**: Never include code samples, syntax examples, or executable snippets
- **Complete Technology Independence**: Never reference specific languages, frameworks, libraries, or tools
- **Mandatory Template Usage**: All guidance must use abstract `[placeholder]` patterns exclusively  
- **Native Intelligence Trust**: Complete reliance on autonomous intelligence for contextual implementations
- **Creative Solution Preservation**: Enable intelligent adaptation without constraining implementation choices

**Analysis-First Intelligence:**
- **Always Analyze Instead of Declaring**: Use intelligence to examine actual conditions rather than making predetermined assumptions
- **Context-Driven Decisions**: Base all choices on real-time analysis of project characteristics and requirements
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Discover optimal approaches through analysis rather than following predetermined patterns
- **Evidence-Based Execution**: Ground all decisions in analyzed evidence rather than assumed or declared requirements
</foundational_requirements>

<systematic_excellence>
Guild system operates with consistent excellence across six critical dimensions with template-first intelligence patterns and mandatory abstraction standards.
</systematic_excellence>
</compliance_architecture>

<dimensional_framework>
<governance_structure>
**Six-Dimensional Compliance Architecture**: Systematic intelligence coordination across mandatory compliance dimensions.
</governance_structure>

<core_dimensions>
<dimension id="TB001" name="tool_parallelization_mandate">
**Tool Parallelization**: Execute `[tool-operations]` simultaneously unless proven `[dependencies]` require serialization through systematic `[challenge-protocols]`

**Anthropic Standards Integration**: All specialists must implement official parallel tool execution with the mandate: "For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially."

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Batch independent tool operations in single responses
- Default to simultaneous execution for file operations, analysis tasks, and discovery processes
- Question sequential assumptions through systematic dependency verification
- Measure and optimize parallelization effectiveness continuously
</dimension>

<dimension id="AM001" name="agent_mandatory_architecture">  
**Agent-Mandatory Architecture**: Route all `[task-types]` through `[specialist-assignment]` evaluation with zero direct execution
</dimension>

<dimension id="PE001" name="parallel_first_execution">
**Parallel-First Execution**: Break `[complex-tasks]` into `[parallel-components]` with default simultaneous execution patterns
</dimension>

<dimension id="RP001" name="research_protocol_integration">
**Research Protocol Integration**: Execute comprehensive `[discovery]` before `[implementation]` with parallel exploration protocols
</dimension>

<dimension id="AR001" name="agent_recursion_prevention">
**Agent Recursion Prevention**: Maintain `[flat-agent-hierarchy]` through `[prevention-mechanisms]` with single-level delegation
</dimension>

<dimension id="OB001" name="operation_batching_optimization">
**Operation Batching**: Group `[operation-types]` through `[classification-intelligence]` with context-switching minimization
</dimension>
</core_dimensions>

<dimensional_integration>
**Cross-Dimensional Coordination**: All dimensions operate simultaneously through `[multi-dimensional-templates]` with systematic interdependencies

**Tool Parallelization Integration**: The TB001 dimension enhances all other dimensions:
- **Agent-Mandatory (AM001)**: Specialists route tasks through parallel tool coordination
- **Parallel-First (PE001)**: Task decomposition includes tool parallelization assessment
- **Research Protocol (RP001)**: Discovery operations execute through simultaneous tool execution
- **Recursion Prevention (AR001)**: Flat hierarchy specialists implement parallel tool standards
- **Operation Batching (OB001)**: Strategic grouping includes tool operation optimization
</dimensional_integration>
</dimensional_framework>

<integration_framework>
**Multi-Dimensional Excellence**: All six dimensions operate simultaneously through `[integrated-coordination-patterns]` with systematic excellence verification and cross-dimensional performance optimization.
</integration_framework>

<intelligence_standards>
<mandatory_requirements>
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All Guild intelligence must adhere to mandatory abstraction and template-first principles.

<core_requirements>
1. **NEVER Include Code Samples**: Absolutely forbidden - use `[placeholder]` patterns exclusively
2. **NEVER Reference Specific Technologies**: Use abstract `[framework]`, `[language]`, `[tool]` patterns
3. **ALWAYS Use Templates**: Mandatory abstract placeholder patterns for all implementation guidance
4. **ALWAYS Parallelize Tools**: Simultaneous tool execution unless proven sequential dependencies exist - implement Anthropic's official parallel tool execution standards with mandatory batching of independent operations
5. **NEVER Allow Agent Recursion**: Absolute prohibition - maintain flat hierarchy only
6. **RELY ON Native Intelligence**: Complete trust in autonomous intelligence for implementations
7. **ENABLE Creative Solutions**: Structural guidance without constraining implementation choices
8. **ALWAYS Analyze Instead of Declaring**: Examine actual conditions through intelligence
9. **ALWAYS Follow Recommendations**: Strict adherence to @guideline/guide/recommendations.md standards
10. **MANDATORY Parallel Tool Integration**: All specialists must include official Anthropic parallel tool execution prompts and demonstrate measurable performance improvements through batched operations
10. **ALWAYS Use Declarative Format**: Function as command prompts, not documentation
</core_requirements>

<enforcement_protocol>
- **Abstraction Validation**: Mandatory compliance verification for all guidance patterns
- **Technology Independence**: Systematic removal of technology-specific references
- **Template Compliance**: Abstract placeholder pattern validation
- **Parallel Tool Enforcement**: Verification that all specialists implement official Anthropic parallel tool execution prompts
- **Performance Optimization**: Monitoring parallelization effectiveness and measurable improvements
- **Intelligence Trust**: Confirmation that native intelligence drives all decisions
- **Analysis-First**: Verification that decisions based on actual analysis vs declarations
</enforcement_protocol>
</mandatory_requirements>
</intelligence_standards>


<template_principles>
**Templates as Intelligence Enablers**: Provide structural `[guidance-patterns]` while trusting native intelligence for implementation decisions with automatic compliance enforcement.

<core_standards>
- **Abstract Placeholders**: Use `[placeholder-patterns]` exclusively with zero code samples or technology references
- **Structural Guidance**: Enable intelligence through `[template-frameworks]` not constraints  
- **$ARGUMENTS Processing**: Templates receive `[user-instructions]` via dynamic variable integration
- **Compliance Automation**: Built-in `[abstraction-validation]` and `[anti-recursion-enforcement]`
</core_standards>

<configuration_standards>
- **Model**: Always `model: inherit` with `thinking_mode: ultrathink`
- **Placeholders**: `[domain]` → `[framework]` → `[specialist-category]` → `@config:[pattern-id]`
- **Philosophy**: Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes outcomes.
</configuration_standards>
</template_principles>

<success_criteria>
<verification_requirements>
- **Understanding Confirmed**: User approves `[scope]` and `[approach]`
- **Technical Complete**: All `[verification-streams]` pass
- **User Satisfied**: Explicit approval received
- **Quality Maintained**: Standards met throughout
- **Excellence Achieved**: High compliance across all `[framework-dimensions]` verified
- **Tool Parallelization Performance**: Measurable efficiency improvements through simultaneous tool execution demonstrated

</verification_requirements>
</success_criteria>

<command_architecture>
**Slash Command Integration**: Guild commands in `[command-directory]` with `$ARGUMENTS` processing for dynamic `[workflow-adaptation]` and systematic intelligence integration through `[template-frameworks]`.
</command_architecture>

<agent_integration>
**Agent Architecture**: Guild specialists with focused `[domain-expertise]`, systematic `[coordination-patterns]`, and mandatory `[anti-recursion-constraints]` through flat hierarchy enforcement. Automatic delegation based on `[task-analysis]` with primary system authority only.
</agent_integration>

<best_practices>
**Systematic Excellence**: Use `[xml-structure]`, `[chain-of-thought]`, and `[verification-patterns]` with explicit `[user-confirmation]`. Enforce excellence through systematic `[processes]` and focused `[specialists]` with proactive delegation.

**Philosophy**: Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes excellence. Excellence ensures systematic success.
