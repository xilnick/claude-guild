# Guild System Framework

## Core Philosophy

**Structure enables intelligence. Intelligence optimizes structure.**

The Guild system balances systematic methods with adaptive intelligence:

- **Systematic Foundation**: Provides reliability and comprehensive coverage
- **Intelligent Optimization**: Enables excellence and creative solutions  
- **Unified Integration**: Combines both for superior outcomes
- **Continuous Evolution**: Improves systems based on insights

## Decision Authority

**Clear boundaries resolve conflicts:**

- **Structure Governs**: Safety standards, quality gates, coverage requirements
- **Intelligence Governs**: Agent selection, coordination strategies, specialist creation approaches
- **User Decides**: Scope, priorities, trade-offs, satisfaction

## Core Principles

**Adaptive Intelligence**: Trust native intelligence within coordination boundaries. Use systematic understanding for multi-agent coordination.

**Parallel-First Execution**: Default to simultaneous execution. Sequential only when dependencies require it.

**Task Decomposition**: Break complex work into parallelizable components. Challenge serial assumptions.

**Strategic Specialist Creation**: Create specialists when parallel benefits exceed coordination costs. Batch launches for efficiency.

**Agent-Mandatory Execution**: ALL tasks must be executed through agents. Direct execution is prohibited. Research, implementation, and verification must all be delegated to appropriate specialists.

**Quality Standards**: Follow all Anthropic best practices from `recommendations.md`. Maintain project conventions and error handling.

**Template Standards**: Create examples as simple templates without excessive detail. Provide structure that enables intelligence, not constraints that limit creativity.

**Modernization Research**: Research current versions and best practices to avoid outdated libraries, APIs, and tool usage. Verify compatibility and security of dependencies.

**Impact Analysis**: Research all project locations where changes may be needed to ensure complete implementation without gaps. Map dependencies and affected areas.

## Mandatory Agent Usage Protocol

**NO DIRECT EXECUTION ALLOWED:**
- Research tasks → Deploy research specialist
- Implementation work → Create implementation specialist  
- Verification tasks → Deploy verification specialist
- Analysis work → Use analysis specialist
- Coordination needs → Create coordination specialist

**UNIVERSAL AGENT REQUIREMENT:**
Every task component, regardless of complexity, must be handled by a dedicated specialist. This includes:
- File reading and analysis
- Code writing and modification
- Testing and validation
- Documentation creation
- Error handling and debugging

**AGENT-FIRST DECISION TREE:**
1. Identify task requirements
2. Create or select appropriate specialist
3. Delegate complete responsibility to agent
4. Coordinate between multiple specialists as needed
5. Never bypass agent layer for direct execution

## Execution Flow

### Understanding Phase
- Create research specialist to analyze requirements and clarify scope
- Deploy analysis agent to research current versions, best practices, and security
- Use discovery specialist to identify all affected project areas  
- Coordinate specialist findings to determine coordination needs
- Present consolidated analysis to user for confirmation

### Decomposition Phase  
- Deploy decomposition specialist to break tasks into atomic, parallelizable units
- Create mapping agent to identify all affected project areas and prevent implementation gaps
- Use analysis specialist to distinguish true dependencies from assumed dependencies
- Design coordination specialists to manage interfaces between work streams
- Architect specialist teams for maximum parallel efficiency

### Execution Phase
- Create execution specialists for all implementation work - no direct task execution allowed
- Deploy coordination agent to manage parallel specialist launches and task routing
- All specialists must have comprehensive descriptions (3-4 sentences minimum)
- Create monitoring specialist to track coordination points and detect gaps

### Verification Phase
- Create verification specialists for all quality assurance tasks
- **Functional Specialist**: Verify requirements met and workflows working
- **Integration Specialist**: Ensure components communicate properly  
- **Quality Specialist**: Confirm patterns followed, maintainability, error handling
- **User Satisfaction Coordinator**: Gather feedback and confirm completion

### Iteration Phase
- Deploy iteration specialists to continue until all verification passes and user satisfied
- Create gap-resolution agents to fix issues immediately and coordinate re-verification
- Use completion specialist to ensure user confirmation before considering work complete

## Template Principles

**Examples as Templates**: All examples should be simple templates that provide structure without excessive implementation details.

**Template Characteristics:**
- **Minimal Specificity**: Use placeholders like `[task-description]` rather than detailed implementations
- **Structural Guidance**: Show the pattern, not the complete solution
- **Intelligence Enablers**: Provide enough structure to guide, not enough to constrain
- **Adaptable Framework**: Templates should work across different contexts and use cases

**Template vs Over-Specification:**
- ✅ **Template**: `<specialist_prompt>Handle [domain] requirements using [approach]</specialist_prompt>`
- ❌ **Over-Specified**: Detailed 50-line specialist prompts with specific implementations

**Philosophy**: Templates trust intelligence to fill in the details appropriately for each context.

## Success Criteria

- **Understanding Confirmed**: User approves scope and approach
- **Technical Complete**: All verification streams pass
- **User Satisfied**: Explicit approval received
- **Quality Maintained**: Standards met throughout

## Best Practices

- Use XML tags for structure (per `recommendations.md`)
- Apply chain of thought for complex analysis
- Ground work in actual project files
- Allow uncertainty expression
- Verify iteratively
- Get explicit user confirmation

**Templates as guidance, not constraints. Structure enables intelligence to excel.**
