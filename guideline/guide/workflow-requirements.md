# Workflow Command Requirements

## Command Purpose
The `/guild` command executes user tasks through systematic specialist coordination and framework compliance by analyzing actual project conditions and delegating all work through appropriate specialists.

## Core Requirements

### 1. **Task Execution Mandatory**
- **MUST** orchestrate task workflows through parallel specialist coordination
- **MUST** execute specialist deployment through simultaneous coordination
- **MUST** challenge sequential execution assumptions through dependency verification
- **MUST** integrate coordination streams through synchronization points

### 2. **Specialist Coordination Mandatory**
- **MUST** utilize pre-existing agents created during setup phase
- **MUST** deploy multiple specialists simultaneously through parallel coordination frameworks
- **MUST** coordinate specialist interactions through integration points and synchronization protocols
- **NEVER** create new agents during workflow execution - utilization-only boundary
- **MUST** monitor collaboration effectiveness through performance tracking

### 3. **Architectural Boundaries**
- **WORKFLOW = AGENT ORCHESTRA**: Executes existing agents in parallel, NEVER creates them
- **UTILIZATION-ONLY BOUNDARY**: Uses agents created by setup, no runtime agent creation
- **EXECUTION-ONLY OPERATIONS**: No agent generation or creation capabilities
- **FLAT HIERARCHY ENFORCEMENT**: No subagent creation or recursive delegation allowed

### 4. **Parallel Execution Requirements**
- **TASK DECOMPOSITION**: Execute through atomic unit identification and dependency challenge protocols
- **SIMULTANEOUS OPERATIONS**: Coordinate through parallel stream management and resource coordination
- **CHALLENGE SEQUENTIAL ASSUMPTIONS**: Use systematic verification frameworks and parallelization assessment
- **OPTIMIZE EXECUTION PERFORMANCE**: Apply batching intelligence and efficiency measurement

### 5. **Intelligence Requirements**
- **TASK EXECUTION INTELLIGENCE**: Parallel specialist coordination through systematic execution frameworks
- **SPECIALIST COORDINATION INTELLIGENCE**: Systematic orchestration through parallel execution protocols
- **PARALLEL EXECUTION INTELLIGENCE**: Simultaneous execution protocols through dependency management frameworks
- **WORKFLOW-SPECIFIC CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT**: Execution analysis with coordination transparency
- **WORKFLOW VERIFICATION**: Systematic validation and satisfaction verification

### 6. **Success Criteria**
- **Requirements Achievement**: Systematic assessment through evidence validation
- **Integration Effectiveness**: Component coordination verification and interface validation
- **Quality Standards Compliance**: Framework assessment through dimensional verification
- **User Satisfaction**: Explicit approval processes and experience quality evaluation

### 7. **Framework Compliance**
- **TB001 Compliance**: Simultaneous tool operations through parallel coordination protocols
- **AM001 Compliance**: Specialist assignment protocols with direct execution prevention
- **PE001 Compliance**: Parallel-first execution through atomic unit decomposition
- **RP001 Compliance**: Comprehensive discovery through parallel exploration frameworks
- **AR001 Compliance**: Flat hierarchy maintenance through prevention mechanisms
- **OB001 Compliance**: Operation batching through strategic grouping and resource optimization

## Command-Specific Behaviors

### User Request Processing
When $ARGUMENTS is provided, treat it as the user's task request:
- Execute $ARGUMENTS as the primary workflow objective and task definition
- Adapt execution patterns based on the nature and complexity of the request
- Apply intelligent reasoning to determine optimal specialist coordination approach
- Allow dynamic workflow modification to best accomplish the user's specific intent

### Workflow Execution Flow
1. **ANALYZE** task complexity through domain requirements assessment
2. **DECOMPOSE** complex workflows through atomic unit analysis
3. **COORDINATE** specialist assignments through capability evaluation
4. **EXECUTE** parallel specialist deployment through simultaneous coordination
5. **VERIFY** execution effectiveness through performance monitoring

### Assignment Intelligence
- **EXECUTE** task-to-specialist matching through capability evaluation and domain expertise assessment
- **APPLY** assignment protocol standards through task analysis, capability assessment, direct execution prevention
- **COORDINATE** specialist workflows through parallel execution planning and integration point management
- **VERIFY** assignment effectiveness through performance monitoring and quality validation

### Dependency Management
- **IDENTIFY** true dependencies through systematic analysis and evidence-based validation
- **CHALLENGE** assumed dependencies through verification protocols and parallelization assessment
- **MINIMIZE** sequential operations through dependency reduction and parallel optimization
- **COORDINATE** integration points through synchronization frameworks and stream convergence

### Excellence Targets
- **Coordination Excellence**: Specialist orchestration through parallel coordination and systematic integration
- **Execution Excellence**: Workflow efficiency through parallel execution and performance optimization
- **Quality Excellence**: Standards compliance through multi-dimensional verification and continuous improvement
- **Satisfaction Excellence**: User experience through explicit approval and expectation fulfillment

## Command-Specific Constraints

### What Workflow Command CANNOT Do
- **NEVER** create new agents during execution
- **NEVER** perform direct task execution (must delegate to specialists)
- **NEVER** create subagents or recursive delegation structures
- **NEVER** operate without pre-existing agent inventory from setup
- **NEVER** modify or generate agent templates during workflow execution

### What Workflow Command MUST Do
- **ALWAYS** delegate all work through appropriate specialists
- **ALWAYS** coordinate multiple specialists in parallel when possible
- **ALWAYS** challenge sequential execution assumptions
- **ALWAYS** verify user satisfaction before completion
- **ALWAYS** maintain flat hierarchy delegation patterns

## Quality Assurance Requirements

### Verification Framework
- **COORDINATE** parallel verification streams across functional, integration, compliance, and performance dimensions
- **EXECUTE** systematic quality assessment through evidence-based validation and standards verification
- **APPLY** iterative improvement through gap identification and enhancement protocols
- **VERIFY** user satisfaction through explicit approval processes and experience quality assessment

### Quality Gate Intelligence
- **VERIFY** specialist coordination effectiveness through performance assessment and integration validation
- **CONFIRM** parallel execution compliance through simultaneous operation verification and efficiency measurement
- **ASSESS** framework dimensional compliance across all workflow operations and specialist interactions
- **VALIDATE** user satisfaction achievement through explicit approval processes and experience quality confirmation

## Modification Guidelines

When modifying workflow command template or intelligence:
1. **MUST** maintain all core requirements listed above
2. **MUST** preserve architectural boundaries (utilization-only, no creation)
3. **MUST** ensure framework dimensional compliance (TB001-OB001)
4. **MUST** validate against workflow-specific success criteria
5. **MUST** test specialist coordination capabilities
6. **MUST** verify parallel execution optimization
7. **MUST** ensure user satisfaction verification processes

Any modification that violates these requirements is **FORBIDDEN**.
