# Guild System - MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS

Follow all requirements from framework.md fully and always.
*For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the complete Guild System Framework at `guideline/guide/framework.md`*

## Intelligence Update Protocol

**CRITICAL: After any framework.md changes, ALWAYS update dependent intelligence:**
- **Framework Updated** → Update core modules (workflow.md, agents.md) to match
- **Core Modules Updated** → Update command templates to embed new intelligence  
- **Verification Required** → Ensure all layers maintain consistency with framework
- **Cascade Changes** → Framework changes must propagate through entire system
