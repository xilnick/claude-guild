## 🏗️ Architecture & How It Works

### Agent Classification System

Guild uses a **sophisticated dual-agent architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

#### Context-Only Agents (Analysis & Planning)
**Never modify code** - focused on understanding and strategy:

- **Main thread reasoning**: Deep requirement analysis with advanced thinking (integrated)
  - Identifies edge cases, constraints, and implications
  - Clarifies ambiguous requirements and technical dependencies
  - Provides structured analysis for implementation agents

- **`guild-planning-agent`**: Strategic workflow coordination and task routing
  - Creates comprehensive implementation strategies
  - Coordinates enhanced parallel agent execution with dependency analysis and dynamic rebalancing
  - Optimizes resource allocation and task sequencing

- **`guild-research-agents`**: Context gathering and information synthesis  
  - Analyzes existing codebase patterns and architecture
  - Integrates external documentation and best practices
  - Builds comprehensive context packages for implementation

#### Implementation Agents (Code & Changes)
**Make actual modifications** - focused on execution:

- **`guild-verification-agent`**: Quality validation and testing execution
  - Runs tests, validates implementations against requirements
  - Performs security, performance, and accessibility audits
  - Can make corrective changes based on validation results

- **Technology Engineers**: Domain-specific implementation specialists
  - **`guild-frontend-component-engineer`**: Component patterns, state management, UI architecture
  - **`guild-backend-api-engineer`**: API middleware, routing, authentication patterns
  - **`guild-database-engineer`**: Schema design, queries, performance optimization
  - **Plus 20+ other technology-specific specialists**

### Context Engineering System

**Advanced Context Management** with XML-structured handoffs:

```xml
<!-- Agent-to-agent communication protocol -->
<context-handoff>
  <executive-summary>Key decisions and requirements distilled</executive-summary>
  <structured-context>
    <technical-constraints>Framework limitations, API restrictions</technical-constraints>
    <business-requirements>User stories, acceptance criteria</business-requirements>
    <implementation-guidance>Step-by-step technical approach</implementation-guidance>
  </structured-context>
  <quality-gates>
    <success-criteria>Measurable validation requirements</success-criteria>
    <testing-strategy>Unit, integration, and e2e test requirements</testing-strategy>
    <escalation-triggers>Conditions requiring human intervention</escalation-triggers>
  </quality-gates>
</context-handoff>
```

**Context Optimization Features**:
- **Reference-Based Linking**: Efficient file:line citations instead of code duplication
- **Progressive Detail Building**: Incrementally expand context as needed
- **Hierarchical Summarization**: Multi-level context compression
- **Automatic Context Pruning**: Remove irrelevant information dynamically

### Workflow Execution Engine

**Optimized Three-Phase Process**:

1. **🎯 Target Analysis** (Ultrathink reasoning - MANDATORY)
   - Extract EXACT requirements from user request
   - Determine OPTIMAL agent count (not maximum)
   - Identify work units for parallel execution
   - Present plan for user approval

2. **⚡ Parallel Research** (When needed)
   - Main thread spawns ALL research agents
   - Simultaneous documentation gathering
   - Shared knowledge cache for all agents
   - No agent hierarchies - main thread control only

3. **🚀 Parallel Implementation** (After approval)
   - Main thread spawns OPTIMAL number of agents
   - ALL agents execute simultaneously
   - Each agent owns exclusive work domain
   - Results integrated by main thread

3. **Local Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test installation locally
   node install.js
   
   # Test Guild system creation
   /guild:setup
   
   # Test workflows
   /guild "simple test task"
   
   # Clean up test artifacts
   rm -rf .claude .guild CLAUDE.md
   ```

4. **Publication Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Full publication workflow with testing
   ./publish.sh
   
   # Test from NPM registry
   npx claude-guild@latest
   ```

### Architecture Guidelines

**Template System Architecture**:
- **Templates** (`templates/`) contain reusable components embedded into commands
- **Commands** (`commands/`) are self-contained workflow definitions  
- **Generated Files** (`.guild/`, `.claude/`) are created from templates during installation
- **Specification** (`guideline/README.md`) is the authoritative definition of all behavior

**Agent Design Principles**:
- **Context-Only Agents**: Analysis, planning, research - never modify code
- **Implementation Agents**: Code changes, file creation, testing execution
- **Clear Handoff Protocols**: XML-structured context transfer between agents
- **Technology Specialization**: Domain-specific expertise with framework knowledge

### Contribution Guidelines

**Before Contributing**:
- [ ] **Update guideline/README.md** with complete specification of changes
- [ ] **Update templates** to reflect new specifications  
- [ ] **Update commands** to use modified templates properly
- [ ] **Test locally** with `node install.js` and workflow commands
- [ ] **Validate** that `.guild/` and `.claude/` generation works correctly

**Code Quality Requirements**:
- All changes must be specified in guideline/README.md first
- Templates must contain only content needed for installation
- Commands must be self-contained after template embedding
- Agent definitions must follow context-only vs implementation classification
- Thinking mode assignments must be appropriate for agent complexity

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Local installation works (`node install.js`)
- [ ] Agent generation creates correct specialists for test projects  
- [ ] Workflow commands execute multi-stage processes correctly
- [ ] Context handoff between agents functions properly
- [ ] Standalone agents activate automatically for appropriate tasks

### Feature Request & Bug Report Process

**Feature Requests**:
1. **Describe Use Case**: Clear problem statement and user story
2. **Propose Solution**: How should this work within Guild's architecture?
3. **Consider Integration**: How does this fit with existing workflows?
4. **Provide Examples**: Concrete usage examples and expected behavior

**Bug Reports**:
1. **Environment Details**: Project type, technology stack, Guild configuration
2. **Reproduction Steps**: Clear step-by-step process to reproduce issue
3. **Expected vs Actual**: What should happen vs what actually happens
4. **Context Information**: Include relevant `.guild/instructions.md` or agent configurations

**Priority Guidelines**:
- **Critical**: Breaks core workflow functionality, prevents installation
- **High**: Affects major features, causes data loss, security vulnerabilities  
- **Medium**: Feature gaps, performance issues, usability problems
- **Low**: Documentation improvements, minor enhancements, edge cases

## 🏗️ Agent Classification System

Guild uses **Four Core Cognitive Personas** with clear thinking approaches:

### Cognitive Personas (How Agents Think)

**4 Core Thinking Approaches**:

- **Systems Architect**: Structural thinking, integration, big-picture design
- **Analytical Thinker**: Data-driven optimization, performance, algorithms
- **Quality Guardian**: Risk-aware validation, testing, reliability
- **Domain Expert**: Business logic, requirements, practical solutions

### Agent Organization

**Main Thread Control**:
- Main thread performs target analysis with ultrathink
- Main thread spawns ALL agents (research and implementation)
- No agent spawns other agents - flat hierarchy
- All agents use `model: sonnet` for consistency

**Communication Protocol**: All agents use structured XML handoff templates for seamless context transfer and quality assurance.

## ⚙️ Key Differentiators

- **Target Focus Philosophy** - Do EXACTLY what's requested, nothing more
- **Mandatory Parallel Execution** - All multi-agent tasks run simultaneously
- **Optimal Agent Count** - Use precise number needed, not maximum
- **4 Cognitive Personas** - Simple, clear thinking approaches
- **Intelligence-Driven** - Claude discovers everything through analysis
- **All Sonnet Models** - Consistent model usage across all agents

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **3x Speed Improvement** through mandatory parallel execution
- **Zero Scope Creep** with target-focused approach
- **Optimal Resource Usage** with right-sized agent teams
- **100% Installation Reliability** through self-contained architecture
- **Simple Configuration** with minimal setup complexity
