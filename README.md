## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Customization

### Configuration Hierarchy

Guild follows a **flexible configuration system** with clear priority hierarchy:

```yaml
Priority Order (Highest to Lowest):
  1. Direct User Prompts: Your specific requests override all system behavior
  2. Project Configuration (.guild/instructions.md): Optional project-specific requirements
  3. System Defaults: Built-in workflow and agent behavior

Design Philosophy: "Optionality First"
  - .guild/instructions.md contains ONLY optional user requirements
  - System works perfectly with empty configuration
  - User maintains full control through direct prompts
```

### Thinking Modes Configuration

**Advanced Reasoning Control**: Customize cognitive resource allocation for different agents:

```yaml
# .guild/instructions.md
thinking_modes:
  guild-planning-agent:
    thinking_mode: think  # Standard reasoning for strategic planning
    model: opus               # Premium model for complex planning
    
  main-thread-reasoning:
    thinking_mode: think    # Enhanced analysis integrated in guild command
    model: sonnet               # Main thread uses selected model
    
  implementation_agents:
    thinking_mode: think      # Standard efficiency for implementation
    model: sonnet            # Balanced model for execution
```

**Thinking Mode Options**:
- `think`: Standard cognitive resources for strategic tasks
- `think`: Standard reasoning for detailed analysis tasks  
- `think`: Standard efficient reasoning for routine implementation

### Project-Specific Specialization

**Technology Stack Configuration**:
```yaml
# .guild/instructions.md

  frameworks: [next.js, tailwindcss, prisma]
  testing: [jest, cypress, playwright]
  deployment: [vercel, railway]
  
standards:
  code_style: [prettier, eslint]
  documentation: [jsdoc, storybook]
  security: [owasp, snyk]
```

**Custom Agent Specialization**:
```yaml
# .guild/instructions.md  
custom_agents:
  - name: guild-analytics-engineer
    role: "Analytics and tracking implementation"
    specialization: "Google Analytics, Mixpanel, custom event tracking"
    activation_keywords: [analytics, tracking, events, metrics]
    
  - name: guild-mobile-engineer  
    role: "Mobile application development"
    specialization: "Cross-platform mobile frameworks and native UI/UX patterns"

```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & How It Works

### Agent Classification System

Guild uses a **sophisticated dual-agent architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

#### Context-Only Agents (Analysis & Planning)
**Never modify code** - focused on understanding and strategy:

- **Main thread reasoning**: Deep requirement analysis with advanced thinking (integrated)
  - Identifies edge cases, constraints, and implications
  - Clarifies ambiguous requirements and technical dependencies
  - Provides structured analysis for implementation agents

- **`guild-planning-agent`**: Strategic workflow coordination and task routing
  - Creates comprehensive implementation strategies
  - Coordinates enhanced parallel agent execution with dependency analysis and dynamic rebalancing
  - Optimizes resource allocation and task sequencing

- **`guild-research-agents`**: Context gathering and information synthesis  
  - Analyzes existing codebase patterns and architecture
  - Integrates external documentation and best practices
  - Builds comprehensive context packages for implementation

#### Implementation Agents (Code & Changes)
**Make actual modifications** - focused on execution:

- **`guild-verification-agent`**: Quality validation and testing execution
  - Runs tests, validates implementations against requirements
  - Performs security, performance, and accessibility audits
  - Can make corrective changes based on validation results

- **Technology Engineers**: Domain-specific implementation specialists
  - **`guild-frontend-component-engineer`**: Component patterns, state management, UI architecture
  - **`guild-backend-api-engineer`**: API middleware, routing, authentication patterns
  - **`guild-database-engineer`**: Schema design, queries, performance optimization
  - **Plus 20+ other technology-specific specialists**

### Context Engineering System

**Advanced Context Management** with XML-structured handoffs:

```xml
<!-- Agent-to-agent communication protocol -->
<context-handoff>
  <executive-summary>Key decisions and requirements distilled</executive-summary>
  <structured-context>
    <technical-constraints>Framework limitations, API restrictions</technical-constraints>
    <business-requirements>User stories, acceptance criteria</business-requirements>
    <implementation-guidance>Step-by-step technical approach</implementation-guidance>
  </structured-context>
  <quality-gates>
    <success-criteria>Measurable validation requirements</success-criteria>
    <testing-strategy>Unit, integration, and e2e test requirements</testing-strategy>
    <escalation-triggers>Conditions requiring human intervention</escalation-triggers>
  </quality-gates>
</context-handoff>
```

**Context Optimization Features**:
- **Reference-Based Linking**: Efficient file:line citations instead of code duplication
- **Progressive Detail Building**: Incrementally expand context as needed

### Architecture Guidelines

**Template System Architecture**:
- **Templates** (`templates/`) contain reusable components embedded into commands
- **Commands** (`commands/`) are self-contained workflow definitions  
- **Generated Files** (`.guild/`, `.claude/`) are created from templates during installation
- **Specification** (`guideline/README.md`) is the authoritative definition of all behavior

**Agent Design Principles**:
- **Context-Only Agents**: Analysis, planning, research - never modify code
- **Implementation Agents**: Code changes, file creation, testing execution
- **Clear Handoff Protocols**: XML-structured context transfer between agents
- **Technology Specialization**: Domain-specific expertise with framework knowledge

### Contribution Guidelines

**Before Contributing**:
- [ ] **Update guideline/README.md** with complete specification of changes
- [ ] **Update templates** to reflect new specifications  
- [ ] **Update commands** to use modified templates properly
- [ ] **Test locally** with `node install.js` and workflow commands
- [ ] **Validate** that `.guild/` and `.claude/` generation works correctly

**Code Quality Requirements**:
- All changes must be specified in guideline/README.md first
- Templates must contain only content needed for installation
- Commands must be self-contained after template embedding
- Agent definitions must follow context-only vs implementation classification
- Thinking mode assignments must be appropriate for agent complexity

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Local installation works (`node install.js`)
- [ ] Agent generation creates correct specialists for test projects  
- [ ] Workflow commands execute multi-stage processes correctly
- [ ] Context handoff between agents functions properly
- [ ] Standalone agents activate automatically for appropriate tasks

### Feature Request & Bug Report Process

**Feature Requests**:
1. **Describe Use Case**: Clear problem statement and user story
2. **Propose Solution**: How should this work within Guild's architecture?
3. **Consider Integration**: How does this fit with existing workflows?
4. **Provide Examples**: Concrete usage examples and expected behavior

**Bug Reports**:
1. **Environment Details**: Project type, technology stack, Guild configuration
2. **Reproduction Steps**: Clear step-by-step process to reproduce issue
3. **Expected vs Actual**: What should happen vs what actually happens
4. **Context Information**: Include relevant `.guild/instructions.md` or agent configurations

**Priority Guidelines**:
- **Critical**: Breaks core workflow functionality, prevents installation
- **High**: Affects major features, causes data loss, security vulnerabilities  
- **Medium**: Feature gaps, performance issues, usability problems
- **Low**: Documentation improvements, minor enhancements, edge cases

## üèóÔ∏è Agent Classification System

Guild uses a **sophisticated dual-agent architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

### Context-Only Agents (Analysis & Planning)
**Never modify code** - focused on understanding and strategy:

- **Main thread reasoning**: Deep requirement analysis with advanced thinking (integrated)
- **`guild-planning-agent`**: Strategic workflow coordination (advanced thinking)  
- **`guild-research-agents`**: Context gathering and information synthesis

### Implementation Agents (Code & Changes)
**Make actual modifications** - focused on execution:

- **`guild-verification-agent`**: Quality validation and testing execution
- **Technology Engineers**: Domain-specific implementation specialists (frontend frameworks, backend APIs, databases, etc.)

**Communication Protocol**: All agents use structured XML handoff templates for seamless context transfer and quality assurance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Differentiators

- **Self-contained architecture** with zero-dependency global installation
- **Complete template embedding** ensuring 100% reliable setup across environments
- **Advanced context engineering** with XML-structured packages
- **Integrated thinking modes** for appropriate cognitive resource allocation
- **Technology-agnostic design** with universal workflow patterns
- **Structured agent communication** with quality gates and validation checkpoints

## üìä Success Metrics

- **100% installation reliability** through self-contained setup architecture
- **Zero-failure setup process** eliminating missing file errors
- **50-70% performance improvement** through context optimization
- **Advanced thinking quality** with appropriate thinking mode selection
- **Global distribution compatibility** ensuring identical system creation
