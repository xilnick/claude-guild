### ✅ Guild System Solution
- **🧠 Project-aware specialists** that learn your patterns
- **⚡ 5-10x faster** through parallel execution  
- **👤 Human-in-the-middle control** - your approval required
- **📚 Persistent knowledge** across sessions
- **✅ Built-in verification** ensures complete, quality results

# In your project directory
/guild:setup
```
Creates intelligent specialists tailored to your codebase.

### 3. Execute Tasks
```bash

## 💡 Real-World Examples

### Simple: Bug Fix (1-3 minutes)
```
You: /guild "fix the login validation error"
Guild: → Login Specialist analyzes your auth patterns
       → Identifies issue in validation logic  
       → Fixes bug following your error handling conventions
       → Updates tests and verifies functionality
```

### Complex: New Feature (5-8 minutes vs 30-60 minutes traditionally)
```
You: /guild "implement real-time chat feature"  
Guild: → Frontend Specialist (chat UI components)
       → Backend Specialist (WebSocket handling)
       → Database Specialist (message storage)
       → Testing Specialist (integration tests)
       → All work simultaneously with coordinated integration
```
