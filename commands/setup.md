   ```

### Stage 2: üéØ Simple Agent Creation Strategy

**Unified Engineer Architecture**:
- **Single Planning Agent**: One `guild-planning-agent` for unified task coordination and routing
- **Framework Engineers**: Create `guild-[framework]-engineer` with context-driven specialization (UI + state + docs + testing)
- **Agent Naming**: Use systematic naming convention: `guild-[technology]-engineer`
- **System Integration**: All agents configured to reference `.guild/overview.md` master reference

**Simple Agent Creation Logic**:

**Phase 2A: Framework-Agnostic Core Agent Creation**:
- **CLI Detected**: `guild-cli-engineer` (unified planning + implementation)
- **Package Management**: `guild-package-engineer` (unified planning + implementation)
- **Backend API**: `guild-backend-engineer` (unified planning + implementation)
- **Frontend App**: `guild-frontend-engineer` (unified planning + implementation)
- **Database**: `guild-database-engineer` (unified planning + implementation)

**Phase 2B: Framework-Coupled Agent Creation**:
- Create specialized agents for detected frameworks and significant libraries
- Use basic agent template with integrated planning and implementation capabilities
- Focus on project-specific technology needs without complex research protocols

### Stage 3: üìÅ Guild System Structure Creation

**System File Creation**:
1. **Create .guild Directory**: Ensure `.guild/` directory exists in project root
2. **Create Agent Directory**: Ensure `.claude/agents/guild/` subdirectory exists for clean agent separation
3. **Generate Core Files**: Create all required Guild system files using embedded template content:
   - `instructions.md` - User-configurable project settings with detected requirements
   - `overview.md` - Master reference containing workflow stage definitions and system rules
   - `agents.md` - Agent creation templates and standards
   - `ignore.md` - File exclusion patterns with soft ignore behavior

**Template Integration**: All templates are directly embedded in this setup command after installation and used inline for .guild folder creation.

### Stage 4: ü§ñ Agent Role & Specialization Definition

4. **Community Best Practices**: Integrate community standards, common patterns, and industry practices

**Phase 5B: Specialization Boundary Enforcement**:
1. **Scope Validation**: Ensure agent understanding aligns with defined role boundaries
2. **Coupling Verification**: Confirm agent handles all coupled concerns within their scope
3. **Separation Validation**: Verify agent doesn't overlap with other agents' boundaries
4. **Context Coherence**: Ensure injected context forms coherent, actionable specialization

**Context Injection Examples**:

**React Engineer Context Injection**:
```
Framework Context Injected:
- React Patterns: Hooks, component composition, state management, lifecycle patterns
- Redux Integration: State management patterns, store configuration, middleware usage
- Router Integration: Navigation patterns, route configuration, protected routes
- Testing Integration: Component testing, hooks testing, integration testing patterns
- Performance: React optimization, memoization, bundle splitting, SSR considerations
- Ecosystem: Common libraries (React Query, Formik, etc.), build integration, deployment patterns

Result: Agent understands React ecosystem holistically and can handle any React-related task within defined boundaries
```

**Express Engineer Context Injection**:
```  
Framework Context Injected:
- Express Patterns: Middleware, routing, error handling, request/response patterns
- Database Integration: ORM patterns, connection management, query optimization
- Authentication: Passport integration, JWT patterns, session management
- API Design: REST patterns, validation, documentation, testing strategies
- Security: Security middleware, CORS, helmet, input validation
- Performance: Caching, compression, clustering, monitoring patterns

Result: Agent understands Express ecosystem holistically and can handle any Express-related task within defined boundaries
```

**Context Injection Validation**:
- **Completeness Check**: Agent has sufficient context for all responsibilities within their scope
- **Accuracy Check**: Injected context aligns with current best practices and official recommendations
- **Coherence Check**: Context forms unified understanding enabling effective decision-making
- **Boundary Check**: Context doesn't include information outside agent's defined boundaries

### Stage 6: ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Integration

**User Configuration**:
- **Ultrathink Mode**: Configure enhanced agent coordination based on user preferences
- **Model Specifications**: Add model fields only when user provides specialized requirements in additional guidance
