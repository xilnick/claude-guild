## Template-Based Agent Creation Process

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW**: Execute the complete technology-driven agent creation process with template inlining as defined in GUIDELINE.md:

### Stage 1: 🔍 Advanced Technology Detection & Discovery

**Phase 1A: Preset Technology Stack Analysis**:
- **Package Analysis**: Examine package.json, dependencies, devDependencies to identify frameworks and libraries
- **File Structure Analysis**: Analyze directory structure to identify project patterns and architecture
- **Configuration Detection**: Identify build tools, testing frameworks, deployment configurations
- **Language Detection**: Identify primary and secondary programming languages used
- **Framework Identification**: Detect specific frameworks (React, Vue, Express, FastAPI, etc.)

**Phase 1B: Advanced Discovery & Research**:
- **Unknown Technology Identification**: Analyze dependencies for unrecognized libraries and frameworks
- **Emerging Technology Detection**: Identify cutting-edge or niche technologies not in preset patterns
- **Research Integration**: Use available MCP servers for deep library documentation analysis
- **WebSearch Enhancement**: Research current technology trends and integration patterns
- **Dynamic Specialization Analysis**: Determine agent specialization requirements for discovered technologies

**Phase 1C: Component Discovery & Context Collection**:
- **UI Component Scanning**: Discover existing components in src/components, app/components
- **Component Library Detection**: Identify Material-UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, etc.
- **API Route Mapping**: Scan routes/, api/, controllers/ for endpoint patterns
- **Database Schema Extraction**: Analyze Prisma schema, TypeORM entities, Mongoose models
- **Testing Pattern Recognition**: Identify test files and testing frameworks
- **Build Configuration Analysis**: Webpack, Vite, Next.js config understanding

**Component Context Building**:
```yaml
For Each UI Framework Detected:
  1. Scan component directories
  2. Build component inventory:
     - Component names and locations
     - Props and interfaces
     - Used UI libraries
     - Styling patterns
  3. Inject into engineer context:
     - Existing components list
     - Component library APIs
     - Design patterns in use
     - Accessibility standards

For Each Backend Framework:
  1. Scan route definitions
  2. Build API inventory:
     - Endpoint paths and methods
     - Middleware chains
     - Authentication setup
     - Validation schemas
  3. Inject into engineer context:
     - Route patterns
     - Middleware usage
     - Error handling patterns
     - Security configurations

For Database Systems:
  1. Analyze schema files

   ```
   For each dependency in project:
   - Identify technology type and usage patterns
   - Determine if specialized agent is needed
   - Create appropriate engineer agent based on project needs
   ```

### Stage 2: 🎯 Simple Agent Creation Strategy

**Unified Engineer Architecture**:
- **Single Planning Agent**: One `guild-planning-agent` for unified task coordination and routing
- **Framework Engineers**: Create `guild-[framework]-engineer` with context-driven specialization (UI + state + docs + testing)
- **Agent Naming**: Use systematic naming convention: `guild-[technology]-engineer`
- **System Integration**: All agents configured to reference `.guild/overview.md` master reference

**Simple Agent Creation Logic**:

**Phase 2A: Framework-Agnostic Core Agent Creation**:
- **CLI Detected**: `guild-cli-engineer` (unified planning + implementation)
- **Package Management**: `guild-package-engineer` (unified planning + implementation)
- **Backend API**: `guild-backend-engineer` (unified planning + implementation)
- **Frontend App**: `guild-frontend-engineer` (unified planning + implementation)
- **Database**: `guild-database-engineer` (unified planning + implementation)

**Phase 2B: Framework-Coupled Agent Creation**:
- Create specialized agents for detected frameworks and significant libraries
- Use basic agent template with integrated planning and implementation capabilities
- Focus on project-specific technology needs without complex research protocols

### Stage 3: 📁 Guild System Structure Creation

**System File Creation**:
1. **Create .guild Directory**: Ensure `.guild/` directory exists in project root
2. **Create Agent Directory**: Ensure `.claude/agents/guild/` subdirectory exists for clean agent separation
3. **Generate Core Files**: Create all required Guild system files using embedded template content:
   - `instructions.md` - User-configurable project settings with detected requirements
   - `overview.md` - Master reference containing workflow stage definitions and system rules
   - `agents.md` - Agent creation templates and standards
   - `ignore.md` - File exclusion patterns with soft ignore behavior

**Template Integration**: All templates are directly embedded in this setup command after installation and used inline for .guild folder creation.

### Stage 4: 🤖 Agent Role & Specialization Definition

- **Technology Focus**: Specialized for specific technologies within Guild workflow system

### Stage 5: 🧠 Context Injection & Specialization Process

**CRITICAL**: Framework context must be systematically injected into agents during creation to build precise specialization.

**Context Injection Protocol**:

**Phase 5A: Framework Knowledge Injection**:
1. **Official Documentation Context**: Inject framework-specific patterns, best practices, and official recommendations
2. **Ecosystem Integration Context**: Add knowledge of coupled libraries, common integrations, and ecosystem patterns  
3. **Project-Specific Context**: Include detected project patterns, existing conventions, and configuration specifics
4. **Community Best Practices**: Integrate community standards, common patterns, and industry practices

**Phase 5B: Specialization Boundary Enforcement**:
1. **Scope Validation**: Ensure agent understanding aligns with defined role boundaries
2. **Coupling Verification**: Confirm agent handles all coupled concerns within their scope
3. **Separation Validation**: Verify agent doesn't overlap with other agents' boundaries
4. **Context Coherence**: Ensure injected context forms coherent, actionable specialization

**Context Injection Examples**:

**React Engineer Context Injection**:
```
Framework Context Injected:
- React Patterns: Hooks, component composition, state management, lifecycle patterns
- Redux Integration: State management patterns, store configuration, middleware usage
- Router Integration: Navigation patterns, route configuration, protected routes
- Testing Integration: Component testing, hooks testing, integration testing patterns
- Performance: React optimization, memoization, bundle splitting, SSR considerations
- Ecosystem: Common libraries (React Query, Formik, etc.), build integration, deployment patterns

Result: Agent understands React ecosystem holistically and can handle any React-related task within defined boundaries
```

**Express Engineer Context Injection**:
```  
Framework Context Injected:
- Express Patterns: Middleware, routing, error handling, request/response patterns
- Database Integration: ORM patterns, connection management, query optimization
- Authentication: Passport integration, JWT patterns, session management
- API Design: REST patterns, validation, documentation, testing strategies
- Security: Security middleware, CORS, helmet, input validation
- Performance: Caching, compression, clustering, monitoring patterns

Result: Agent understands Express ecosystem holistically and can handle any Express-related task within defined boundaries
```

**Context Injection Validation**:
- **Completeness Check**: Agent has sufficient context for all responsibilities within their scope
- **Accuracy Check**: Injected context aligns with current best practices and official recommendations
- **Coherence Check**: Context forms unified understanding enabling effective decision-making
- **Boundary Check**: Context doesn't include information outside agent's defined boundaries

### Stage 6: ⚙️ Configuration Integration

**User Configuration**:
- **Ultrathink Mode**: Configure enhanced agent coordination based on user preferences
- **Model Specifications**: Add model fields only when user provides specialized requirements in additional guidance
- **Custom Agents**: Create additional agents based on user-provided guidance
- **Local Tool Integration**: Configure integration with detected local development tools

**System Validation**:
- **File Integrity**: Verify all Guild system files created successfully
- **Agent Validation**: Confirm all agents follow YAML format requirements and system compliance
- **Reference Validation**: Ensure all agents properly reference `.guild/overview.md` master reference
- **Workflow Integration**: Validate agent integration with Guild workflow system
