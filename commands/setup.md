## Purpose

Perform comprehensive project analysis and generate a complete Guild system tailored specifically to your codebase using embedded guideline intelligence. Completely self-contained with no external dependencies.

## Embedded Guideline Intelligence

**Core System Principles** (Built-in):
- **Prompt-Driven Intelligence**: All agent behavior defined by prompts, not hardcoded patterns
- **Dynamic Agent Generation**: Agents created based on project-specific analysis
- **Context Engineering**: XML-structured handoff protocols with thinking mode optimization
- **Technology-Agnostic Design**: Universal patterns that work with any technology stack

**Agent Classification System** (Built-in):
- **Context-Only Agents**: Never make changes, create comprehensive context packages
- **Implementation Agents**: Execute changes based on structured context from context-only agents

**Workflow Architecture** (Built-in):
- Default: reasoning → research → planning → implementation
- --full: reasoning → research → planning → implementation → testing → verification → refactoring
- --fix: reasoning → research → planning → fix stage
- --plan: reasoning → research → planning → save to file
- --research: reasoning → research
- --spec: reasoning → research → planning → spec creation
- --refactor: reasoning → research → refactor-planning → refactoring

## Execution Protocol

**Step 1: Comprehensive Project Analysis**

Analyze project using Claude Code's native tools:

1. **Core Project Understanding**:
   - Read README.md, package.json/requirements.txt/Cargo.toml
   - Read main configuration files (build systems, tooling, deployment)
   - Read key source files to understand implementation patterns

2. **Project Structure Analysis**:
   - Explore directory structure to map project organization
   - Identify architectural patterns and code structure
   - Assess project complexity and sophistication level
   - Find key directories (source, tests, docs, configuration)

3. **Technology Stack Detection**:
   - Search for framework patterns using Grep tool
   - Find testing patterns and quality tool configurations
   - Discover workflow patterns (development, build, deployment)
   - Identify frontend, backend, CLI, package patterns

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - Analyze architectural style (MVC, microservices, CLI, library)
   - Understand coding standards and project practices
   - Map technology integration and data flows
   - Assess project domain and complexity requirements

**Step 2: Dynamic Agent Generation**

Generate agents with embedded project intelligence using Write tool:

**.claude/commands/guild.md**:
```yaml
---
name: guild-command  
thinking_mode: think
description: "Project-specific Guild workflow execution command with embedded intelligence"
---

# /guild

**Usage**: `/guild [flags] "task"`

## Purpose

Execute tasks using Guild's comprehensive workflow system with intelligent agent coordination for this specific project.

## Project Intelligence

[EMBEDDED DURING SETUP - Project-specific patterns, technologies, architecture, complexity, workflow optimization]

## Workflow System

**Default Workflow**: `reasoning → research → planning → implementation`

**Specialized Workflows**:
- **`--fix`**: Bug fixing workflow (reasoning → research → planning → fix stage)
- **`--plan`**: Planning-only workflow (reasoning → research → planning → save to file)  
- **`--research`**: Research-only workflow (reasoning → research)
- **`--spec`**: Specification workflow (reasoning → research → planning → spec creation)
- **`--refactor`**: Refactoring workflow (reasoning → research → refactor-planning → refactoring)
- **`--full`**: Comprehensive workflow (reasoning → research → planning → implementation → testing → verification → refactoring)

**Scope Modifiers**:
- **`--project`**: Apply changes project-wide with comprehensive impact analysis

## Execution Protocol

**Configuration Check**: Verify Guild system is configured for this project (.guild/instructions.md exists).

**Agent Coordination**: Use project-specific agents with embedded intelligence:
1. **Reasoning Stage**: guild-reasoning-agent analyzes task with ultrathink mode
2. **Research Stage**: guild-project-research-agent and guild-global-research-agent gather context
3. **Planning Stage**: guild-planning-agent creates implementation strategy with ultrathink mode  
4. **Implementation Stage**: Technology-specific engineers execute based on context packages
5. **Quality Assurance**: guild-verification-agent validates results (if --full or verification flags)

## Project-Specific Optimization

All workflow stages are optimized for this project's:
- **Technology Stack**: [YOUR detected technologies and frameworks]
- **Architectural Patterns**: [YOUR project's architectural decisions and conventions]
- **Development Workflow**: [YOUR build systems, testing approaches, quality tools]
- **Team Patterns**: [YOUR collaboration and code standards]

This project-specific /guild command provides intelligent workflow execution tailored to your codebase and development patterns.
```

**Step 4: System Configuration Generation**

Create complete Guild system configuration using Write tool:

**.guild/instructions.md**:
```markdown
# Guild Agent Instructions

User prompts always override these instructions. These instructions override system defaults.

## Requirements

- **guild-planning-agent**: Use ultrathink mode with opus model for comprehensive strategic planning and analysis
- **All other agents**: Use standard thinking mode for efficient execution unless specified otherwise
```

**.guild/ignore.md**:
```markdown  
# Guild Ignore Patterns

**CRITICAL - MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS**: All Guild agents MUST respect the ignore patterns defined in this file.

**Soft Ignore Behavior**: These patterns are automatically respected during normal operations. However, if explicitly asked to work with or examine ignored files, agents should override these patterns and access the requested files.

```
.claude/
CLAUDE.md
.guild/
.serena/
.env*
node_modules/
dist/
build/
.git/
.DS_Store
*.log
*.tmp
.cache/
coverage/
[ADDITIONAL PATTERNS BASED ON DETECTED TECHNOLOGY STACK]
```
```

**Step 5: Complete System Validation**

1. **Verify Command Generation**: Confirm all Guild commands created in .claude/commands/
2. **Verify Agent Generation**: Confirm all agents have appropriate project context embedded  
3. **Validate Configuration**: Ensure .guild/ configuration files are properly set up
4. **Test System Integration**: Verify agent coordination works for detected architecture
5. **Document Results**: Provide summary of generated system and capabilities

## Generated Guild System

After running `/guild:setup`, the complete project-specific Guild system is created:

**Generated Command** (in .claude/commands/):
- **guild.md**: Project-specific workflow execution command with embedded project intelligence and guideline-compliant workflows

**Generated Agents** (in .claude/agents/guild/):
- Core agents with embedded project intelligence and patterns
- Technology-specific engineers based on detected technology stack
- All agents configured with appropriate thinking modes for this project

**Generated Configuration** (in .guild/):
- instructions.md with project-specific agent requirements and thinking modes
- ignore.md with technology-appropriate exclusion patterns for this project

**Global Management Commands**: `/guild:ignore` and `/guild:instructions` are globally available for cross-project usage and are not generated by setup.

**Complete Project Intelligence**: All generated components understand your specific codebase, technology stack, and development patterns.

## Standalone Mode (--standalone)

When `--standalone` flag is used, generate self-contained specialist agents without .guild system:
