description: "Fully self-contained Guild system setup with complete embedded guideline intelligence"
---

## Purpose

Perform comprehensive project analysis and generate a complete Guild system tailored specifically to your codebase using fully embedded guideline intelligence. Completely self-contained with zero external dependencies.

## EMBEDDED GUIDELINE INTELLIGENCE

### Core System Principles (Built-in)

**Prompt-Driven Intelligence Architecture**:
- **All intelligence through prompts**: No hardcoded detection or patterns
- **Claude-native analysis**: Leverage Claude's full understanding capabilities  
- **Dynamic adaptation**: Let Claude determine optimal approaches
- **Future-proof design**: New models automatically improve the system
- **Technology-agnostic**: Universal patterns that work with any technology stack

**Agent Classification System** (Built-in):
- **Context-Only Agents**: Never make changes, create comprehensive context packages
- **Implementation Agents**: Execute changes based on structured context from context-only agents
- **Thin Agent Architecture**: Metadata-only (<20 lines) that reference centralized processes
- **Thinking Mode Integration**: Ultrathink for strategic decisions, think-harder for analysis, think for execution

**Context Engineering Excellence** (Built-in):
- **Structured Handoffs**: XML-tagged context packages with priority classification
- **Progressive Detail Building**: Start with summaries, expand based on agent requests
- **Reference-Based Linking**: Use file:line citations instead of content duplication
- **Automatic Pruning**: Remove outdated or irrelevant context information

**Performance Optimization** (Built-in):
- **Cognitive Resource Allocation**: Match thinking complexity to task requirements
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents with context synchronization
- **Context Compression**: Hierarchical summarization with drill-down capability
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Claude adjusts approach based on project patterns

### Workflow Architecture (Built-in)

**Standard Workflow Patterns** (Embedded):
```yaml
Default: reasoning → research → planning → implementation
--full: reasoning → research → planning → implementation → testing → verification → refactoring
--fix: reasoning → research → planning → fix stage  
--plan: reasoning → research → planning → save to file
--research: reasoning → research
--spec: reasoning → spec_analysis → spec_update → research → planning → implementation → validation
--refactor: reasoning → research → refactor-planning → refactoring
```

**Execution Strategies** (Embedded):
- **Sequential**: One agent at a time with structured context handoffs
- **Parallel**: Multiple independent agents with synchronized context sharing
- **Pipeline**: Overlapping stages with progressive context building
- **Hybrid**: Mixed strategies with adaptive context management

**Context Flow Architecture** (Embedded):
```xml
<context-flow>
  <generation-phase>
    Context-only agents (ultrathink/think-harder) → structured XML packages
  </generation-phase>
  <transfer-phase>
    <context-package priority="critical|important|supplementary">
      <executive-summary>Key decisions and outcomes</executive-summary>
      <implementation-context>Technical requirements and constraints</implementation-context>
      <validation-criteria>Success metrics and acceptance criteria</validation-criteria>
      <references>Relevant files, functions, and documentation</references>
    </context-package>
  </transfer-phase>
  <usage-phase>
    Implementation agents (think) → validate context → execute with quality gates
  </usage-phase>
  <decay-phase>
    Automatic pruning → retain critical decisions → archive for future reference
  </decay-phase>
</context-flow>
```

### Agent Architecture Intelligence (Built-in)

**Agent Placement Requirements** (Critical):
- **MANDATORY**: All Guild agents MUST be created in `.claude/agents/guild/` subdirectory
- **Directory Structure**: Namespace isolation between guild system agents and standalone specialists
- **Organization**: Clear distinction between agent types for better discoverability

```

### Technology Detection Intelligence (Built-in)

**Pattern-Based Detection** (No hardcoding):
```yaml
Detection Process:
  1. Analyze project structure using Claude Code's native tools
  2. Read configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.)
  3. Examine source code patterns and architectural styles
  4. Identify workflow patterns (development, build, deployment)
  5. Assess project complexity and sophistication level

Technology Categories (Pattern-Based):
  Frontend Patterns: Component frameworks, state management, routing, testing
  Backend Patterns: API frameworks, database integration, middleware, authentication
  CLI Patterns: Command structures, argument parsing, user workflows, distribution
  Package Patterns: API design, distribution strategy, documentation, versioning
  Testing Patterns: Test frameworks, quality tools, coverage requirements
```

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Comprehensive Project Analysis

**Execute comprehensive project analysis using embedded intelligence**:

1. **Pattern-Based Project Intelligence** (Using embedded prompts):
   ```
   Perform deep pattern-based analysis of this project using all available tools.
   
   Technology-Agnostic Pattern Recognition:
   - Architectural patterns (layered, microservices, component-based, event-driven, domain-driven)
   - Development flow patterns (work organization, lifecycle, quality assurance)
   - Data flow patterns (information movement, transformation, boundaries)
   - Integration patterns (external systems, interfaces, dependencies)
   - Scalability patterns (growth handling, modularity, extensibility)
   
   Beyond Technology Labels - focus on underlying patterns that transcend tools
   Context Understanding - domain knowledge, business rules, user interactions, operations
   ```

2. **Complexity Profiling** (Using embedded intelligence):
   ```
   Create multi-dimensional complexity profile:
   - Cognitive complexity (domain knowledge, context maintenance, interconnection)
   - Structural complexity (pattern interaction, abstraction layers, integration points)
   - Change complexity (context requirements, ripple effects, validation needs)
   - Coordination complexity (concern interaction, orchestration, parallelization)
   
   Intelligence Allocation Strategy:
   - Enhanced thinking modes for strategic decisions and complex analysis
   - Standard thinking modes for efficient execution and routine operations
   - Agent specialization level appropriate for complexity
   - Context management strategy for optimal performance
   ```

3. **Technology Stack Detection** (Pattern-based):
   - Search for framework patterns using Grep tool
   - Find testing patterns and quality tool configurations
   - Discover workflow patterns (development, build, deployment)
   - Identify architectural styles and implementation patterns

### Step 2: Dynamic Agent Generation with Embedded Intelligence

**CRITICAL DIRECTORY SETUP**: Execute in sequence:
1. **Create directory**: Use Bash `mkdir -p .claude/agents/guild`
2. **Verify creation**: Use LS tool to confirm `.claude/agents/guild/` exists
3. **Generate agents**: All agents MUST be created in `.claude/agents/guild/` subdirectory

**Mandatory Core Agents** (Always Generated with Embedded Intelligence):

### Step 3: System Configuration Generation with Embedded Intelligence

Create complete Guild system configuration using Write tool:

**.guild/instructions.md** (Project-Specific Configuration):
```markdown
# Guild Agent Instructions

User prompts always override these instructions. These instructions override system defaults.

## Embedded Project Intelligence

**Project Context**: [SUMMARY OF PROJECT PATTERNS AND CHARACTERISTICS]
**Complexity Profile**: [PROJECT-SPECIFIC COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT]  
**Technology Context**: [PROJECT-SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION]
**Quality Standards**: [PROJECT-SPECIFIC QUALITY EXPECTATIONS]

## Agent Requirements (Project-Optimized)

- **guild-planning-agent**: Use ultrathink mode with opus model for comprehensive strategic planning aligned with project's complexity profile
- **guild-reasoning-agent**: Use ultrathink mode for deep requirement analysis appropriate for project's domain complexity
- **guild-specification-agent**: Use think-harder mode for thorough specification analysis matching project's documentation standards
- **All other agents**: Use standard thinking mode for efficient execution optimized for project's workflow patterns

## Project-Specific Workflow Guidance

**Default Workflow Optimization**: Based on project's complexity profile and workflow patterns
**Context Engineering**: Enhanced structured handoffs optimized for project's architectural patterns
**Quality Integration**: Validation and testing aligned with project's established quality standards
**Performance Optimization**: Resource allocation and parallelization based on project's scalability patterns
```

**.guild/ignore.md** (Technology-Specific Patterns):
```markdown
# Guild Ignore Patterns

**CRITICAL - MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS**: All Guild agents MUST respect the ignore patterns defined in this file.

**Soft Ignore Behavior**: These patterns are automatically respected during normal operations. However, if explicitly asked to work with or examine ignored files, agents should override these patterns and access the requested files.

## Project-Specific Ignore Patterns

**Core System Files**:
```
.claude/
CLAUDE.md
.guild/  
.serena/
.env*
.git/
.DS_Store
*.log
*.tmp
.cache/
```

**Technology-Specific Patterns** (Generated based on detected technology stack):
```
[TECHNOLOGY-SPECIFIC IGNORE PATTERNS BASED ON PROJECT ANALYSIS]
```

**Project-Specific Patterns** (Based on project structure analysis):
```
[ADDITIONAL PATTERNS BASED ON PROJECT-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS]
```
```

### Step 4: System Validation with Embedded Intelligence

1. **Agent Generation Validation**: Confirm all agents contain embedded project intelligence
2. **Configuration Validation**: Ensure project-specific configuration is properly embedded
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify agent coordination works with project's detected patterns
4. **Intelligence Verification**: Validate that embedded intelligence captures project essence

## STANDALONE MODE (--standalone)
