# /guild

**Usage**: `/guild [flags] "your task prompt"`

**Interactive Mode**: `/guild [flags]` - If no task is provided, Guild will prompt you for the task interactively

**Purpose**: Execute any task with Guild's comprehensive multi-stage workflow system using project-specific agents dynamically discovered at runtime.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY AGENT ORCHESTRATION REQUIREMENT

**CRITICAL**: Guild operates through COMPLETE AGENT DELEGATION. The main thread performs ONLY reasoning - ALL other work MUST be delegated to agents.

**ORCHESTRATION PRINCIPLES**:
1. **Main Thread = Reasoning ONLY**: Uses ultrathink for prompt analysis, then orchestrates agents
2. **Everything Else = Agent Execution**: Research, planning, implementation, validation ALL through agents
3. **Maximum Parallelization**: Execute agents asynchronously whenever possible
4. **No Direct Execution**: Main thread NEVER executes implementation, only coordinates
5. **General-Purpose Agents**: Use for non-specialized async tasks
6. **100% Agent Utilization**: Every non-reasoning task MUST go through an agent

**COMPLIANCE**: This is MANDATORY for prompt-first, agent-orchestrated architecture.

## Workflow Stage System

Guild uses a modular workflow stage system where you can enable/disable specific execution stages:

### Default Workflow Stages (Always Enabled)
- **üß† Reasoning Stage**: Prompt analysis, typo correction, and requirement clarification (`prompt-analysis` stage)
- **üîç Research Stage**: Context gathering and background research (`context-research` stage)
- **üéØ Planning Stage**: Strategic planning and implementation architecture (`planning` stage)  
- **üî® Implementation Stage**: Code execution and development (`implementation` stage)

### Optional Workflow Stages (Enable with Flags)
- **‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring Stage**: Code optimization and cleanup (`refactor-planning` + refactoring execution)
- **üêõ Fix Stage**: Error detection and systematic debugging (`error-detection` stage)
- **üß™ Testing Stage**: Test creation and quality assurance (`testing` stage)
- **‚úÖ Verification Stage**: Final validation against requirements (`verification` stage)

## Command Flags & Stage Triggering Logic

### Disable Default Stages
- `--no-reason` - Disable reasoning stage (skip prompt analysis)
- `--no-plan` - Disable planning stage (skip strategic planning)
- `--no-implement` - Disable implementation stage (planning/analysis only)

### Enable Optional Stages  
- `--reason` - Enable reasoning-only mode (prompt analysis and debugging) when used alone
- `--fix` - Enable fix stage (error detection and debugging) OR fix-only mode when used alone
- `--plan` - Enable planning-only mode (no implementation, save plan to file) when used alone
- `--research` - Enable research-only mode (no planning/implementation) when used alone
- `--refactor` - Enable refactoring stage (code optimization with refactor-planning)
- `--test` - Enable testing stage (test creation and validation)
- `--verify` - Enable verification stage (requirement validation)
- `--full` - Enable comprehensive workflow (combines --verify + --test + --refactor)
- `--spec` - Enable specification-driven mode (update specs first, then implement)

### Scope Modifiers
- `--project` - Apply testing and refactoring to entire project (default: focused on changes only)

## Stage Triggering Logic

### Special Stage Combinations

**Reasoning-Only Mode** (when `--reason` is the ONLY flag specified):
- **Trigger**: `/guild --reason "prompt to analyze"` with no other flags
- **Stages**: reasoning only (no research/planning/implementation)
- **Behavior**: Deep prompt analysis, requirement clarification, and interpretation debugging
- **Use Case**: Prompt debugging, requirement clarification, understanding system interpretation

**Fix-Only Mode** (when `--fix` is the ONLY flag specified):
- **Trigger**: `/guild --fix "bug description"` with no other flags
- **Stages**: reasoning ‚Üí research ‚Üí planning ‚Üí fix stage (no implementation)
- **Behavior**: Systematic bug fixing with root cause analysis and debugging
- **Use Case**: Bug resolution with comprehensive analysis but no new feature implementation

**Planning-Only Mode** (when `--plan` is the ONLY flag specified):
- **Trigger**: `/guild --plan "task"` with no other flags  
- **Stages**: reasoning ‚Üí research ‚Üí planning ‚Üí **prompt to save plan to file**
- **Behavior**: Create comprehensive planning documentation without implementation
- **Use Case**: Strategic analysis and architectural design without any implementation

**Research-Only Mode** (when `--research` is the ONLY flag specified):
- **Trigger**: `/guild --research "query"` with no other flags
- **Stages**: reasoning ‚Üí research (no planning/implementation)
- **Behavior**: Comprehensive context gathering and research synthesis
- **Use Case**: Information gathering and context building for future tasks

**Legacy Planning Mode** (when `--no-implement` is the ONLY flag specified):
- **Trigger**: `/guild --no-implement "task"` with no other flags
- **Stages**: reasoning ‚Üí research ‚Üí planning ‚Üí **prompt to save output**  
- **Behavior**: Execute reasoning, research and planning stages, then ask user if they want to save planning output to a file
- **Use Case**: Strategic analysis and planning without any implementation (legacy support)

**Refactor-Only Mode** (when `--refactor` is the ONLY flag specified):
- **Trigger**: `/guild --refactor "task"` with no other flags  
- **Stages**: reasoning ‚Üí research ‚Üí refactor-planning ‚Üí refactoring execution (skips regular implementation)
- **Behavior**: Focus entirely on code optimization, refactor-planning stage is mandatory
- **Use Case**: Code optimization and cleanup without new feature implementation

**Comprehensive Mode** (when `--full` flag is specified):
- **Trigger**: `/guild --full "task"`
- **Stages**: reasoning ‚Üí research ‚Üí planning ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí testing ‚Üí verification ‚Üí refactoring
- **Behavior**: Complete development lifecycle from analysis through quality assurance
- **Use Case**: Complete feature development with full quality assurance
- **Note**: `--full` flag automatically enables `--test`, `--verify`, and `--refactor`

**Specification-Only Mode** (when `--spec` is the ONLY flag specified):
- **Trigger**: `/guild --spec "task"` with no other flags
- **Stages**: reasoning ‚Üí research ‚Üí planning ‚Üí spec-analysis ‚Üí spec-update (no implementation)
- **Behavior**: Create or update specifications without implementation
- **Use Case**: Documentation management and specification creation without code changes

**Specification-Driven Mode** (when `--spec` flag is combined with other flags):
- **Trigger**: `/guild --spec "task"` combined with other flags (like --full)
- **Stages**: reasoning ‚Üí spec-analysis ‚Üí spec-update ‚Üí research ‚Üí planning ‚Üí implementation
- **Behavior**: Specifications updated BEFORE implementation, ensuring documentation-driven development
- **Use Case**: Feature development requiring specification updates and documentation-first approach
- **Agent**: Automatically includes guild-spec-agent with "think-harder" mode
- **Quality Gate**: Implementation cannot proceed until specifications are properly updated

**Standard Flag Processing**:
1. **Detect flag-only modes**: Check for single flags requiring specialized workflow
   - `--reason` only ‚Üí reasoning-only mode (reasoning stage only)
   - `--fix` only ‚Üí fix-only mode (reasoning + research + planning + fix stage)
   - `--plan` only ‚Üí planning-only mode (reasoning + research + planning + save option)
   - `--research` only ‚Üí research-only mode (reasoning + research)
   - `--spec` only ‚Üí spec-only mode (reasoning + research + planning + spec stages)
   - `--no-implement` only ‚Üí legacy planning mode (reasoning + research + planning + save option)
2. **Start with defaults**: reasoning + research + planning + implementation (if not flag-only mode)
3. **Process --full flag**: If present, enable test + verify + refactor stages
4. **Process --spec flag**: If combined with other flags, enable specification-driven workflow
5. **Apply disable flags**: Remove specified stages  
6. **Apply enable flags**: Add optional stages
7. **Handle special modes**: Adjust stage flow for specific combinations

## Interactive Task Prompting

If no task description is provided with the command, enter interactive mode:

### Interactive Mode Flow

1. **Detect Missing Task**: Check if task description was provided
2. **Analyze Project Context**: Identify project type and technologies
3. **Display Interactive Prompt**: Show context-aware prompt with examples
4. **Process User Input**: Validate and execute with provided task

### Interactive Prompt Template

```
üèõÔ∏è **Guild Ready - [Detected Technologies]**

What task would you like to execute?

**Examples for your project:**
‚Ä¢ [Context-specific example based on detected stack]
‚Ä¢ [Another relevant example]
‚Ä¢ [Testing/refactoring example if applicable]

**Selected flags:** [Show any flags provided]
**Available flags:** --reason, --fix, --plan, --research, --spec, --refactor, --test, --verify, --project, --full, --no-implement

Enter your task description:
```

### Context-Aware Examples

Based on detected technologies, provide relevant examples:

**Frontend Project:**
- Create a new dashboard component with UI framework
- Add error boundary to the application
- Implement lazy loading for routes

**Backend API:**
- Add rate limiting middleware
- Create CRUD endpoints for resources
- Implement authentication system

**Full-Stack:**
- Build user profile feature with API and UI
- Add real-time notifications with WebSocket
- Implement file upload with progress tracking

## Guild Configuration Check

First, read Guild instructions and discover available agents for this project:

### Read Instructions First

**Step 1: Load Guild Instructions**
- Read `.guild/instructions.md` to get current configuration
- Parse concurrency settings, workflow preferences, and project rules
- Apply these settings to all subsequent execution
- If missing, create with default settings during execution

### Dynamic Agent Discovery

**Step 2: Check Guild Configuration Status**
- Look for `.guild/overview.md` (primary indicator of setup completion)
- OR look for `.guild/instructions.md` (project configuration)
- If either exists, Guild IS configured (proceed with available resources)
- Also check for `.guild/ignore.md` (ignore patterns)

**Step 3: Discover Available Agents**
- Check `.claude/agents/guild/` directory for Guild agents
- Dynamically identify available agents:
  - **Core Agents**: guild-planning-agent, guild-*-research-agent
  - **Implementation Agents**: Any guild-*-engineer agents found
  - **Quality Agents**: guild-verification-agent, guild-spec-agent if present
  - **Project-Specific Agents**: Any other guild-* agents discovered

**Step 4: Adapt Workflow to Available Resources**
- If Guild configured but agents missing: Continue with main thread fallback and offer agent regeneration
- If core agents missing: Use enhanced main thread processing
- If implementation agents missing: Use available engineers or main thread fallback
- If quality agents missing: Skip those stages or provide alternatives
- Always work with what's available in the project

### If Guild NOT Configured

Check these conditions to determine if Guild is truly not configured:
1. `.guild` directory does not exist
2. `.guild/overview.md` is missing
3. `.guild/instructions.md` is missing

If ALL above are true, display this message and STOP:

```
üèõÔ∏è **Guild Not Configured**

Guild is not yet set up for this project. To use the workflow:

1. **Run Setup**: Use `/guild:setup` to analyze your project and create appropriate agents
2. **Flag-Based Workflow**: After setup, use `/guild [flags] "task"` with configurable workflow stages
3. **Available Flags**: --refactor, --fix, --test, --verify, --project, --no-reason, --no-plan, --no-implement

**To get started**: `/guild:setup [optional-guidance]`
```

### If Guild Configured but Agents Missing

If `.guild` exists but `.claude/agents/guild/` is missing or empty:

Display this message and CONTINUE with main thread execution:

```
üèõÔ∏è **Guild Configured - Agents Need Generation**

Guild setup detected but agents are missing.

Options:
1. **Regenerate Agents**: `/guild:setup --regenerate-agents`
2. **Continue Without Agents**: The system will use main thread coordination

Note: Performance is optimized with agents. Consider regenerating them.

Proceeding with main thread fallback execution...
```

### If Guild IS Configured

**CRITICAL**: This command MUST activate the Guild workflow with user-specified flags and stages.

## Workflow Stage Processing

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW ACTIVATION**: Execute the flag-based Guild workflow system with configurable stages:

### Stage Selection & Validation
1. **Parse Flags**: Analyze command flags to determine stage configuration
2. **Default Configuration**: Start with reasoning + planning + implementation stages enabled
3. **Apply Disable Flags**: Remove stages based on --no-* flags
4. **Apply Enable Flags**: Add optional stages based on feature flags
5. **Special Mode Detection**: Handle planning-only and refactor-only modes
6. **Stage Validation**: Ensure at least one meaningful stage is enabled
7. **Scope Configuration**: Set global vs focused scope for testing/refactoring stages

## Agent Coordination Protocol

**ENHANCED SAME-AGENT PARALLELIZATION**:
- **Adaptive Instance Spawning**: Intelligently create 1-3 instances based on workload analysis and complexity estimation
- **Work Estimation Distribution**: Tasks distributed using complexity analysis, not simple round-robin
- **Affinity-Based Task Grouping**: Related tasks (same domain, file type, dependencies) assigned to same instance for context reuse
- **Performance Acceleration**: 4-5x speedup through intelligent parallel processing with minimal coordination overhead
- **Cross-Specialization Work Stealing**: Idle specialists can adapt to help overloaded specialists
- **Example**: 12 API endpoints ‚Üí dependency analysis identifies 3 clusters ‚Üí optimal distribution across instances with 13min total (vs 30min sequential)

**DYNAMIC AGENT SELECTION**:
- **Agent Discovery**: Dynamically find agents in `.claude/agents/guild/` at runtime
- **Core System Agents**: Use guild-planning-agent if available, reasoning done in main thread
- **Research Agents**: Use any guild-*-research-agent agents found
- **Implementation Agents**: Use any guild-*-engineer agents discovered
- **Quality Agents**: Use guild-verification-agent, guild-spec-agent if present
- **Fallback Strategy**: If specific agents missing, adapt workflow or provide guidance

**ADAPTIVE WORKFLOW**:
- **With Full Agent Set**: Execute complete workflow with all stages
- **Partial Agent Set**: Execute available stages, skip unavailable ones
- **Minimal Agent Set**: Provide guidance for completing Guild setup
- **No Agents**: Direct user to run `/guild:setup` command

**Context Handoffs**: Clean context flow between available agents with well-defined interfaces matching discovered agent capabilities.

## IMPLEMENTATION: Agent Orchestration System

**CRITICAL**: The following implementation steps MUST be executed by Claude Code to achieve Guild compliance:

### Step 1: Agent Discovery Implementation

**Execute Agent Discovery**:
```bash
# Use LS tool to check for Guild agents directory
ls .claude/agents/guild/
```

**Process Discovery Results**:
1. **Check Configuration Status**: First verify Guild setup by checking for `.guild/overview.md` or `.guild/instructions.md`
2. **If Guild NOT configured**: Display "Guild Not Configured" message and stop execution  
3. **If Guild configured but agents missing**: Display "Agents Need Generation" message and continue with main thread fallback
4. **If agents exist**: Scan available agents and parse agent types and capabilities
5. **Build Execution Plan**: Determine workflow stages based on available resources (agents or main thread fallback)

### Step 2: Workflow Orchestration Implementation

**Multi-Stage Agent Execution**:

#### Stage 1: Reasoning Stage (Main Thread with Ultrathink)
**Implementation**:
- Execute reasoning using ultrathink mode for comprehensive analysis
- Analyze user prompt, correct typos, clarify requirements
- Create structured reasoning context for subsequent agents
- **Context Output**: Structured analysis package for next stages

#### Stage 2: Research Stage (Parallel Agent Coordination)
**Implementation**:
```
EXECUTE IN PARALLEL:

IF guild-project-research-agent EXISTS:
  Task guild-project-research-agent with: 
  "Analyze project context for: [USER_TASK]
  
  Focus on:
  - Codebase patterns and architecture
  - Technology stack and constraints
  - Quality standards and testing approaches
  - Project-specific patterns and conventions
  
  Input Context: [REASONING_OUTPUT]
  Output: Structured project research package"

IF guild-global-research-agent EXISTS:
  Task guild-global-research-agent with:
  "Research best practices for: [USER_TASK]
  
  Focus on:
  - Framework patterns and community standards
  - Integration approaches and libraries
  - Performance and scalability considerations
  - Security and quality best practices
  
  Input Context: [REASONING_OUTPUT]
  Output: Structured global research package"

WAIT FOR PARALLEL COMPLETION
MERGE RESEARCH RESULTS into comprehensive research context
```

#### Stage 3: Planning Stage (Strategic Coordination)
**Implementation**:
```
IF guild-planning-agent EXISTS:
  Task guild-planning-agent with:
  "Create implementation strategy for: [USER_TASK]
  
  Input Context: 
  - Reasoning Analysis: [REASONING_OUTPUT]
  - Research Results: [RESEARCH_OUTPUT]
  
  Create strategic plan including:
  - Implementation approach and architecture
  - Agent assignments and coordination
  - Risk assessment and mitigation
  - Success criteria and validation
  
  Output: Strategic implementation plan with agent coordination"

ELSE:
  Create basic implementation plan using main thread analysis
```

#### Stage 4: Implementation Stage (Specialized Agent Execution)
**Implementation**:
```
IDENTIFY REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION AGENTS based on:
- Detected technology patterns
- Available guild-*-engineer agents
- Task complexity and requirements

FOR EACH REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION AGENT:
  IF agent EXISTS in .claude/agents/guild/:
    Task [agent] with:
    "Execute implementation for: [USER_TASK]
    
    Input Context:
    - Strategic Plan: [PLANNING_OUTPUT]
    - Research Context: [RESEARCH_OUTPUT] 
    - Requirements: [REASONING_OUTPUT]
    
    Implement according to plan with focus on:
    - Code quality and project standards
    - Integration with existing patterns
    - Testing and validation requirements
    
    Output: Implementation results and changes"
  
  ELSE:
    Execute implementation using main thread with available context

COORDINATE IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS
VALIDATE INTEGRATION BETWEEN AGENT OUTPUTS
```

#### Stage 5: Quality Assurance Stages (If Enabled)
**Implementation**:
```
IF --test OR --full flag enabled:
  IF guild-verification-agent EXISTS:
    Task guild-verification-agent with:
    "Create comprehensive tests for: [USER_TASK]
    
    Input Context: [IMPLEMENTATION_OUTPUT]
    
    Create and execute tests including:
    - Unit tests for new functionality
    - Integration tests for system interaction
    - Validation tests for requirements compliance
    
    Output: Test results and coverage analysis"

IF --verify OR --full flag enabled:
  Task guild-verification-agent with:
  "Validate implementation against requirements
  
  Input Context: 
  - Original Requirements: [REASONING_OUTPUT]
  - Implementation: [IMPLEMENTATION_OUTPUT]
  
  Verify:
  - Requirements compliance
  - Quality standards adherence
  - Integration correctness
  
  Output: Validation results and issue resolution"

IF --refactor OR --full flag enabled:
  Execute refactoring workflow with planning and implementation agents
```

### Step 3: Context Engineering Implementation

**Structured Context Handoffs**:
```xml
BETWEEN EACH STAGE, CREATE CONTEXT PACKAGE:

<context-handoff>
  <metadata>
    <from-stage>[source-stage]</from-stage>
    <to-stage>[target-stage]</to-stage>
    <timestamp>[ISO-8601]</timestamp>
    <priority>critical</priority>
  </metadata>
  
  <content>
    <summary>[High-level overview]</summary>
    <details>[Stage-specific results]</details>
    <requirements>[Key requirements and constraints]</requirements>
    <next-actions>[Recommended next steps]</next-actions>
  </content>
  
  <validation>
    <success-criteria>[How to measure success]</success-criteria>
    <quality-gates>[Required standards]</quality-gates>
  </validation>
</context-handoff>

PASS CONTEXT PACKAGE TO NEXT STAGE AGENT
VALIDATE CONTEXT RECEIPT AND UNDERSTANDING
```

### Step 4: Error Handling and Fallbacks

**Agent Missing Fallbacks**:
```
FOR EACH REQUIRED AGENT:
  IF agent NOT FOUND in .claude/agents/guild/:
    LOG: "Agent [agent-name] not found, using fallback approach"
    
    FALLBACK OPTIONS:
    1. Execute stage using main thread with enhanced context
    2. Skip stage if not critical to task completion  
    3. Provide user guidance for agent setup if critical
    
    CONTINUE with available agents and adapted workflow
```

**Quality Assurance**:
- Validate each stage completion before proceeding
- Ensure context handoffs are successful
- Monitor agent execution for errors or failures
- Provide clear feedback on workflow progress and results

### Step 5: Dynamic Workflow Adaptation

**Adaptive Execution Based on Available Agents**:
```
DISCOVERED_AGENTS = scan_guild_directory()
REQUIRED_STAGES = parse_flags_and_determine_stages()

FOR EACH REQUIRED_STAGE:
  IF required_agent_available(DISCOVERED_AGENTS):
    execute_stage_with_agent(stage, agent, context)
  ELSE:
    execute_stage_with_fallback(stage, context)
  
  UPDATE context_package WITH stage_results
  VALIDATE stage_completion

FINAL_VALIDATION:
- Ensure all required stages completed
- Validate final output meets requirements
- Provide comprehensive summary of workflow execution
```

## MANDATORY EXECUTION WORKFLOW

**CRITICAL**: Guild operates through COMPLETE AGENT ORCHESTRATION. Main thread is ONLY for reasoning and coordination.

### EXECUTION PHASE 1: Pre-Flight & Agent Discovery

```
1. PARSE COMMAND FLAGS ‚Üí determine workflow stages
2. VALIDATE USER TASK ‚Üí enter interactive mode if missing
3. CHECK GUILD CONFIGURATION: Verify Guild setup by checking `.guild/overview.md` or `.guild/instructions.md`
4. HANDLE CONFIGURATION STATUS:
   - If NOT configured: Display "Guild Not Configured" and STOP
   - If configured but agents missing: Display "Agents Need Generation" and continue with main thread fallback
   - If agents available: Proceed with agent-based execution
5. DISCOVER AND CATEGORIZE available agents by TYPE (if agents exist):
   - Context Generation Agents (research, analysis, synthesis)
   - Strategic Planning Agents (planning, coordination, architecture)
   - Domain Specialist Agents (technology-specific, scope-specific)
   - Implementation Agents (engineers, builders, integrators)
   - Quality Assurance Agents (validation, verification, testing)
   - Utility Agents (general-purpose, async workers)
6. BUILD orchestration plan based on available resources (agents or main thread fallback)
```

### EXECUTION PHASE 2: Main Thread Reasoning (ONLY Main Thread Work)

```
EXECUTE with ultrathink mode (MAIN THREAD):
"Analyze user request: [USER_TASK]

Create comprehensive orchestration plan:
- Clarify requirements and identify constraints
- Decompose task into parallel agent assignments

    parallel_tasks = analyze_tasks_with_dependency_mapping()
    complexity_estimation = estimate_task_complexity(parallel_tasks)
    affinity_groups = group_tasks_by_affinity(parallel_tasks)
    instance_count = calculate_optimal_instances(parallel_tasks, complexity_estimation, max=3)

This implementation ensures Guild operates as designed with proactive sub-agent coordination while maintaining reliability through comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: AGENT TASKING WITHOUT CODE EMBEDDING

**When tasking agents, follow the NO CODE EMBEDDING policy:**

### **‚úÖ CORRECT Agent Tasking Examples:**

**Research Agent Tasking:**
```
"Analyze project's authentication patterns and security approach.
Identify existing authentication methods, session management patterns,
and security considerations used in this project."
```

**Planning Agent Tasking:**
```  
"Create implementation strategy for user authentication feature.
Base plan on discovered project patterns and security requirements.
Include integration approach with existing systems."
```

**Implementation Agent Tasking:**
```
"Implement user authentication system following project's established patterns.
Integrate with existing architecture and maintain consistency with
discovered security practices and coding conventions."
```

### **‚ùå WRONG Agent Tasking (Violates Policy):**

```
"Use this authentication code template:
const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {"
```

**Why Wrong**: Contains embedded code, assumes Express.js, violates all core principles.

### **Intelligence Advantage:**
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Agents analyze YOUR actual project
- **Context-Aware**: Solutions fit YOUR specific architecture
- **Future-Proof**: Works with any technology stack evolution  
- **Intelligent**: Uses Claude's full capabilities, not templates
