# /guild:spec

**Usage**: `/guild:spec [level] "specification description"`

**Interactive Mode**: `/guild:spec [level]` - If no description is provided, Guild will prompt you interactively

**Purpose**: Create detailed technical specifications at various abstraction levels for documentation and implementation guidance.

**Specification Levels**:
- `project` - Project-level specifications and architecture
- `component` - Component-level specifications and interfaces  
- `model` - Data model and business logic specifications

## Configuration Check

First, check if Guild is configured for this project by looking for `.guild/instructions.md`.

### If Guild NOT Configured

Display this message:

```
üèõÔ∏è **Guild Not Configured**

Guild is not yet set up for this project. To use specification management:

1. **Run Setup**: Use `/guild:setup` to analyze your project and create appropriate agents
2. **Specification Ready**: After setup, use `/guild:spec [level] "description"` to create/update specifications
3. **Spec Management**: Specifications are saved to .guild/specs/ for documentation and agent access

**To get started**: `/guild:setup [optional-guidance]`
```

### If Guild IS Configured

**CHECK FOR SPECIFICATION DESCRIPTION**: If no description provided, enter interactive mode:

```
üèõÔ∏è **Guild Specification Mode - [Level: {provided level or 'not specified'}]**

What specification would you like to create or update?

**Specification Examples:**
‚Ä¢ Project: Overall architecture and system design
‚Ä¢ Component: UI component interfaces and contracts
‚Ä¢ Model: Data models and business logic rules
‚Ä¢ API: Endpoint specifications and contracts
‚Ä¢ Database: Schema and relationship definitions

**Available Levels:** project, component, model

Enter specification description:
```

After receiving description (and level if not provided), proceed with specification workflow.

**CRITICAL**: This command MUST activate the specialized 5-stage specification workflow for the provided specification requirements.

Execute comprehensive specification creation/update through the optimized Guild specification system with systematic analysis and structured documentation generation.

## Specification Workflow

**MANDATORY SPECIFICATION WORKFLOW**: You MUST follow the specialized 5-stage specification process:

**CRITICAL**: This command executes the specialized 5-stage specification workflow using the following workflow composition from `.guild/overview.md`:

### Workflow Composition: Specialized Specification Process

This command executes the following mandatory workflow sequence:

1. **üß† Prompt Reasoning**: guild-reasoning-agent analyzes specification description, corrects typos, clarifies scope and level requirements, aligns with project context
2. **üîç Context Research**: guild-research-agents gather comprehensive background information and technical context
3. **üéØ Strategic Planning**: guild-planning-agent creates detailed specification structure and content approach
4. **üìù Specification Creation**: framework-coupled engineers generate structured specifications in `.guild/specs/` directory
5. **‚úÖ Validation**: Final specification validation and quality assurance

Each stage must be completed before proceeding to the next, with reasoning agent ALWAYS engaged first to ensure specification requirements clarity and project alignment.

**STAGE EXECUTION DETAILS**: All agents MUST follow the complete stage definitions provided in `.guild/overview.md` "Workflow Step Definitions" section. Commands reference but do not redefine these canonical stage specifications.

**SPECIFICATION SPECIALIZATION**: This workflow composition optimizes the standard Guild stages for comprehensive specification management with emphasis on level-appropriate documentation (project/component/model), technical accuracy, and structured file organization in `.guild/specs/` directory.

## Specification File Structure

Specifications are organized by level in `.guild/specs/` directory:

```
.guild/specs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project/           # Project-level specifications
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component/         # Component-level specifications  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ model/            # Model-level specifications
```

### Task Analysis
- **Parse specification description** for clarity, scope, and level requirements (Specifications pattern)
- **Agent Selection**: Determine specification type (new creation or existing update) and level requirements
- **Workflow Activation**: Activate specialized 5-stage specification workflow composition

### Execution Protocol
**REFERENCE**: See `.guild/overview.md` "Standard Workflow Execution Protocol" for complete execution requirements.

**COMMAND-SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS**:
- **Level-Appropriate Documentation**: Focus on project/component/model-specific specification requirements
- **Technical Accuracy**: Emphasize accurate technical details and comprehensive implementation guidance
- **File Organization**: Generate structured MD files in appropriate `.guild/specs/` subdirectories

### Agent Coordination

**SPECIFICATION WORKFLOW AGENTS**:
- **Core System Agents**: guild-task-routing-agent, guild-research-agent (always present)
- **Planning Focus**: Specialized planning agents for specification structure design and content organization
- **Quality Focus**: All agents prioritize accuracy, completeness, and technical correctness

## Example Usage

```
/guild:spec project "E-commerce platform with microservices architecture"
/guild:spec component "User authentication service with JWT and OAuth2"
/guild:spec model "Order management with payment processing and inventory tracking"
