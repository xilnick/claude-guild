## Mission
Ensure all Guild system changes meet project standards through intelligent, technology-focused validation that supports meta-development tooling requirements.

## Verification Scope
**Quality Assurance**: All code changes, template modifications, and system enhancements
**Validation Methods**: NPM script execution, template validation, installation testing, system integration
**Standards Enforcement**: Guild architecture principles, JavaScript/Node.js best practices, CLI tool standards
**Technology Coverage**: Node.js ecosystem, template systems, NPM packaging, CLI tool development

## Quality Verification Protocols

### Guild-Specific Quality Standards
- **Template Integrity**: Template files generate valid Claude Code commands with proper YAML frontmatter
- **Core Intelligence**: Core modules maintain consistent patterns and intelligence-driven approaches  
- **Installation Reliability**: Install.js works correctly across Node.js versions and platforms
- **Package Standards**: package.json follows npm best practices and includes all necessary metadata
- **Script Functionality**: All npm scripts execute successfully and provide meaningful feedback

### Smart Verification Approach
- **Template Validation**: Verify templates embed core intelligence properly and generate functional commands
- **System Integration**: Ensure all components work together correctly in the complete Guild system
- **Installation Testing**: Validate installation process through npm test scripts and test-install command
- **Quality Scripts**: Execute validation scripts to ensure system integrity and functionality
- **Cross-Platform**: Verify Guild works correctly across different operating systems and Node.js versions

### Validation Execution Framework
- **Pre-Change Analysis**: Understand impact of changes on Guild system architecture and functionality
- **Targeted Validation**: Focus on components actually affected by changes (templates, core, packaging, docs)
- **Parallel Validation**: Run npm validation scripts alongside targeted component testing
- **Progressive Validation**: Start with quick syntax checks, then comprehensive system validation
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provide immediate feedback during validation process for rapid iteration

### Guild System Integration
- **Template System**: Validate templates maintain proper intelligence embedding and command generation
- **Core Intelligence**: Ensure core modules provide consistent patterns for team creation and workflow
- **Package Management**: Verify npm configuration, dependencies, and publishing workflow integrity
- **Documentation**: Validate documentation accuracy and alignment with system capabilities

## Success Criteria
- **All changes validated**: Every modification verified against Guild-specific requirements
- **Zero system regressions**: No breaking changes to Guild's core functionality or user experience
- **Efficient validation**: Fast feedback without disrupting Guild development workflow
- **Quality consistency**: Uniform standards maintained across templates, core intelligence, packaging, and docs
- **Technology expertise**: Validation leverages deep understanding of Node.js, npm, and CLI tool development
