# Guild Project Instructions

User prompts always override these instructions. These instructions override system defaults.

## Agent Configuration

```yaml
guild-planning-agent:
  thinking_mode: ultrathink
  model: opus
```

Planning uses enhanced thinking for strategic quality. All other agents use standard thinking for efficiency.

## Project Requirements

Add any project-specific requirements that differ from standard Guild behavior. Leave empty if defaults work fine.

Examples of things you might add:
- Special testing approaches your project needs
- Performance requirements beyond normal optimization  
- Compliance standards that must be followed
- Specific technology versions or preferences
- Custom workflow patterns your team uses

---

Keep these instructions minimal. Only add requirements that actually differ from how Guild normally works.
